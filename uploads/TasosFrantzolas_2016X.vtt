1
00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:15.296
I want to start by doing an experiment.

2
00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:20.127
I'm going to play three videos
of a rainy day.

3
00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:24.639
But I've replaced the audio
of one of the videos,

4
00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:27.037
and instead of the sound of rain,

5
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:30.129
I've added the sound of bacon frying.

6
00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:34.929
So I want you think carefully
which one the clip with the bacon is.

7
00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:37.427
(Rain falls)

8
00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:41.120
(Rain falls)

9
00:00:43.447 --> 00:00:45.352
(Rain falls)

10
00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:53.713
All right.

11
00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:57.458
Actually, I lied.

12
00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:58.752
They're all bacon.

13
00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:00.351
(Bacon sizzles)

14
00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.123
(Applause)

15
00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:12.309
My point here isn't really
to make you hungry

16
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.982
every time you see a rainy scene,

17
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:19.926
but it's to show that our brains
are conditioned to embrace the lies.

18
00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:22.614
We're not looking for accuracy.

19
00:01:23.574 --> 00:01:26.359
So on the subject of deception,

20
00:01:26.383 --> 00:01:29.746
I wanted to quote one
of my favorite authors.

21
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.719
In "The Decay of Lying,"
Oscar Wilde establishes the idea

22
00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:42.352
that all bad art comes from copying
nature and being realistic;

23
00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:48.160
and all great art comes
from lying and deceiving,

24
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.883
and telling beautiful, untrue things.

25
00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:55.821
So when you're watching a movie

26
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.222
and a phone rings,

27
00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.248
it's not actually ringing.

28
00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:05.016
It's been added later
in postproduction in a studio.

29
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.894
All of the sounds you hear are fake.

30
00:02:07.918 --> 00:02:09.728
Everything, apart from the dialogue,

31
00:02:09.752 --> 00:02:10.906
is fake.

32
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.590
When you watch a movie and you see
a bird flapping its wings --

33
00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:16.635
(Wings flap)

34
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:20.224
They haven't really recorded the bird.

35
00:02:20.248 --> 00:02:25.242
It sounds a lot more realistic
if you record a sheet

36
00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.818
or shaking kitchen gloves.

37
00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:29.194
(Flaps)

38
00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.612
The burning of a cigarette up close --

39
00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:35.633
(Cigarette burns)

40
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:39.922
It actually sounds a lot more authentic

41
00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:42.791
if you take a small Saran Wrap ball

42
00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:44.033
and release it.

43
00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:47.200
(A Saran Warp ball being released)

44
00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.092
Punches?

45
00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:50.638
(Punch)

46
00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:52.594
Oops, let me play that again.

47
00:02:52.618 --> 00:02:53.817
(Punch)

48
00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:58.091
That's often done by sticking
a knife in vegetables,

49
00:02:58.115 --> 00:02:59.537
usually cabbage.

50
00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:01.933
(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)

51
00:03:02.608 --> 00:03:05.572
The next one -- it's breaking bones.

52
00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:07.821
(Bones break)

53
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.824
Well, no one was really harmed.

54
00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:12.248
It's actually ...

55
00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:16.238
breaking celery or frozen lettuce.

56
00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.303
(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)

57
00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:19.999
(Laughter)

58
00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:25.788
Making the right sounds
is not always as easy

59
00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:27.719
as a trip to the supermarket

60
00:03:27.743 --> 00:03:30.439
and going to the vegetable section.

61
00:03:30.463 --> 00:03:32.838
But it's often a lot more
complicated than that.

62
00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:35.885
So let's reverse-engineer together

63
00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.233
the creation of a sound effect.

64
00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:41.606
One of my favorite stories
comes from Frank Serafine.

65
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.481
He's a contributor to our library,

66
00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:47.067
and a great sound designer for "Tron"
and "Star Trek" and others.

67
00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:53.369
He was part of the Paramount team
that won the Oscar for best sound

68
00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:55.324
for "The Hunt for Red October."

69
00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:58.738
In this Cold War classic, in the '90s,

70
00:03:58.762 --> 00:04:03.547
they were asked to produce the sound
of the propeller of the submarine.

71
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:04.916
So they had a small problem:

72
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.460
they couldn't really find
a submarine in West Hollywood.

73
00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:12.142
So basically, what they did is,

74
00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:15.521
they went to a friend's swimming pool,

75
00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:20.080
and Frank performed
a cannonball, or bomba.

76
00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.085
They placed an underwater mic

77
00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:25.885
and an overhead mic
outside the swimming pool.

78
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.162
So here's what the underwater
mic sounds like.

79
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:30.721
(Underwater plunge)

80
00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:32.934
Adding the overhead mic,

81
00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.911
it sounded a bit like this:

82
00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:37.310
(Water splashes)

83
00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:41.781
So now they took the sound
and pitched it one octave down,

84
00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:44.281
sort of like slowing down a record.

85
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.086
(Water splashes at lower octave)

86
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.517
And then they removed
a lot of the high frequencies.

87
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:52.816
(Water splashes)

88
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.896
And pitched it down another octave.

89
00:04:56.134 --> 00:04:58.422
(Water splashes at lower octave)

90
00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.952
And then they added
a little bit of the splash

91
00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:03.260
from the overhead microphone.

92
00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:06.449
(Water splashes)

93
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.011
And by looping and repeating that sound,

94
00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:10.225
they got this:

95
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.090
(Propeller churns)

96
00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:22.811
So, creativity and technology put together
in order to create the illusion

97
00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:26.006
that we're inside the submarine.

98
00:05:26.688 --> 00:05:30.049
But once you've created your sounds

99
00:05:30.073 --> 00:05:32.467
and you've synced them to the image,

100
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:36.542
you want those sounds to live
in the world of the story.

101
00:05:37.217 --> 00:05:41.251
And one the best ways to do
that is to add reverb.

102
00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:44.432
So this is the first audio tool
I want to talk about.

103
00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:50.140
Reverberation, or reverb,
is the persistence of the sound

104
00:05:50.164 --> 00:05:52.095
after the original sound has ended.

105
00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:54.687
So it's sort of like the --

106
00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:57.747
all the reflections from the materials,

107
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:00.658
the objects and the walls
around the sound.

108
00:06:00.682 --> 00:06:02.894
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.

109
00:06:02.918 --> 00:06:05.920
The original sound is less
than half a second long.

110
00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.108
(Gunshot)

111
00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:11.256
By adding reverb,

112
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.497
we can make it sound like
it was recorded inside a bathroom.

113
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.853
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)

114
00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:20.382
Or like it was recorded
inside a chapel or a church.

115
00:06:20.707 --> 00:06:22.260
(Gunshot reverbs church)

116
00:06:22.863 --> 00:06:24.867
Or in a canyon.

117
00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.780
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)

118
00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.457
So reverb gives us a lot of information

119
00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:35.411
about the space between the listener
and the original sound source.

120
00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:37.544
If the sound is the taste,

121
00:06:37.568 --> 00:06:41.752
then reverb is sort of like
the smell of the sound.

122
00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:44.287
But reverb can do a lot more.

123
00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:48.221
Listening to a sound
with a lot less reverberation

124
00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:50.328
than the on-screen action

125
00:06:50.352 --> 00:06:53.372
is going to immediately signify to us

126
00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:56.039
that we're listening to a commentator,

127
00:06:56.063 --> 00:07:00.854
to an objective narrator that's not
participating in the on-screen action.

128
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:06.482
Also, emotionally intimate
moments in cinema

129
00:07:06.506 --> 00:07:08.453
are often heard with zero reverb,

130
00:07:08.477 --> 00:07:12.447
because that's how it would sound
if someone was speaking inside our ear.

131
00:07:12.844 --> 00:07:14.805
On the completely other side,

132
00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:17.325
adding a lot of reverb to a voice

133
00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.726
is going to make us think
that we're listening to a flashback,

134
00:07:21.457 --> 00:07:24.766
or perhaps that we're inside
the head of a character

135
00:07:25.766 --> 00:07:28.242
or that we're listening
to the voice of God.

136
00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:30.528
Or, even more powerful in film,

137
00:07:30.552 --> 00:07:32.039
Morgan Freeman.

138
00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:33.347
(Laughter)

139
00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:34.538
So --

140
00:07:34.562 --> 00:07:36.792
(Applause)

141
00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:41.193
But what are some other tools or hacks

142
00:07:41.217 --> 00:07:43.077
that sound designers use?

143
00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:46.309
Well, here's a really big one.

144
00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.018
It's silence.

145
00:07:53.627 --> 00:07:57.231
A few moments of silence
is going to make us pay attention.

146
00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:00.141
And in the Western world,

147
00:08:00.165 --> 00:08:02.288
we're not really used to verbal silences.

148
00:08:02.312 --> 00:08:05.341
They're considered awkward or rude.

149
00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:09.930
So silence preceding verbal communication

150
00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:12.901
can create a lot of tension.

151
00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:16.630
But imagine a really big Hollywood movie,

152
00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:20.998
where it's full of explosions
and automatic guns.

153
00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:25.804
Loud stops being loud
anymore, after a while.

154
00:08:25.828 --> 00:08:27.772
So in a yin-yang way,

155
00:08:27.796 --> 00:08:30.933
silence needs loudness
and loudness needs silence

156
00:08:30.957 --> 00:08:33.355
for either of them to have any effect.

157
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.547
But what does silence mean?

158
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:38.509
Well, it depends how
it's used in each film.

159
00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:42.415
Silence can place us inside
the head of a character

160
00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.057
or provoke thought.

161
00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:47.134
We often relate silences with ...

162
00:08:48.474 --> 00:08:49.792
contemplation,

163
00:08:50.378 --> 00:08:51.635
meditation,

164
00:08:53.005 --> 00:08:54.572
being deep in thought.

165
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:59.491
But apart from having one meaning,

166
00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:01.685
silence becomes a blank canvas

167
00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:06.234
upon which the viewer is invited
to the paint their own thoughts.

168
00:09:06.782 --> 00:09:10.458
But I want to make it clear:
there is no such thing as silence.

169
00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:15.457
And I know this sounds like the most
pretentious TED Talk statement ever.

170
00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:21.960
But even if you were to enter
a room with zero reverberation

171
00:09:21.984 --> 00:09:24.049
and zero external sounds,

172
00:09:24.073 --> 00:09:27.190
you would still be able to hear
the pumping of your own blood.

173
00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:32.141
And in cinema, traditionally,
there was never a silent moment

174
00:09:32.165 --> 00:09:34.085
because of the sound of the projector.

175
00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:36.983
And even in today's Dolby world,

176
00:09:37.854 --> 00:09:41.135
there's not really any moment of silence
if you listen around you.

177
00:09:42.305 --> 00:09:44.530
There's always some sort of noise.

178
00:09:44.554 --> 00:09:47.481
Now, since there's no such
thing as silence,

179
00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:51.076
what do filmmakers
and sound designers use?

180
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.596
Well, as a synonym,
they often use ambiences.

181
00:09:56.127 --> 00:09:59.996
Ambiences are the unique background sounds

182
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.068
that are specific to each location.

183
00:10:03.092 --> 00:10:04.941
Each location has a unique sound,

184
00:10:04.965 --> 00:10:06.941
and each room has a unique sound,

185
00:10:06.965 --> 00:10:08.538
which is called room tone.

186
00:10:08.562 --> 00:10:10.985
So here's a recording
of a market in Morocco.

187
00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:13.949
(Voices, music)

188
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.058
And here's a recording
of Times Square in New York.

189
00:10:20.663 --> 00:10:25.186
(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)

190
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:30.891
Room tone is the addition of all
the noises inside the room:

191
00:10:30.915 --> 00:10:33.304
the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.

192
00:10:33.328 --> 00:10:36.239
Here's a recording
of my apartment in Brooklyn.

193
00:10:36.263 --> 00:10:41.141
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler,
the fridge and street traffic)

194
00:10:47.242 --> 00:10:51.546
Ambiences work in a most primal way.

195
00:10:52.538 --> 00:10:55.392
They can speak directly
to our brain subconsciously.

196
00:10:56.358 --> 00:11:02.207
So, birds chirping outside your window
may indicate normality,

197
00:11:02.757 --> 00:11:05.548
perhaps because, as a species,

198
00:11:05.572 --> 00:11:09.709
we've been used to that sound
every morning for millions of years.

199
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.123
(Birds chirp)

200
00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:21.300
On the other hand, industrial sounds
have been introduced to us

201
00:11:21.324 --> 00:11:22.815
a little more recently.

202
00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:25.847
Even though I really like
them personally --

203
00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:28.284
they've been used by one
of my heroes, David Lynch,

204
00:11:28.308 --> 00:11:30.243
and his sound designer, Alan Splet --

205
00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:32.829
industrial sounds often carry
negative connotations.

206
00:11:32.853 --> 00:11:35.607
(Machine noises)

207
00:11:39.912 --> 00:11:44.768
Now, sound effects can tap
into our emotional memory.

208
00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:49.046
Occasionally, they can be so significant

209
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.644
that they become a character in a movie.

210
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:56.994
The sound of thunder may indicate
divine intervention or anger.

211
00:11:58.193 --> 00:12:01.158
(Thunder)

212
00:12:03.777 --> 00:12:07.752
Church bells can remind us
of the passing of time,

213
00:12:07.776 --> 00:12:09.681
or perhaps our own mortality.

214
00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:15.161
(Bells ring)

215
00:12:19.593 --> 00:12:24.083
And breaking of glass can
indicate the end of a relationship

216
00:12:24.107 --> 00:12:25.335
or a friendship.

217
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.011
(Glass breaks)

218
00:12:28.608 --> 00:12:32.161
Scientists believe that dissonant sounds,

219
00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:36.956
for example, brass or wind
instruments played very loud,

220
00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:42.702
may remind us of animal howls in nature

221
00:12:42.726 --> 00:12:45.853
and therefore create a sense
of irritation or fear.

222
00:12:46.326 --> 00:12:49.257
(Brass and wind instruments play)

223
00:12:52.534 --> 00:12:55.706
So now we've spoken
about on-screen sounds.

224
00:12:56.118 --> 00:13:00.751
But occasionally, the source
of a sound cannot be seen.

225
00:13:00.775 --> 00:13:03.299
That's what we call offscreen sounds,

226
00:13:03.323 --> 00:13:04.771
or "acousmatic."

227
00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:07.095
Acousmatic sounds --

228
00:13:07.707 --> 00:13:12.740
well, the term "acousmatic" comes
from Pythagoras in ancient Greece,

229
00:13:12.764 --> 00:13:16.355
who used to teach behind
a veil or curtain for years,

230
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.569
not revealing himself to his disciples.

231
00:13:19.593 --> 00:13:22.381
I think the mathematician
and philosopher thought that,

232
00:13:23.547 --> 00:13:24.698
in that way,

233
00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:29.441
his students might focus
more on the voice,

234
00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:31.429
and his words and its meaning,

235
00:13:31.453 --> 00:13:34.623
rather than the visual of him speaking.

236
00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.346
So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,

237
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.184
or "1984's" Big Brother,

238
00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:45.474
separating the voice from its source,

239
00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:47.389
separating cause and effect

240
00:13:48.199 --> 00:13:51.994
sort of creates a sense
of ubiquity or panopticism,

241
00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:54.098
and therefore, authority.

242
00:13:54.976 --> 00:13:58.037
There's a strong tradition
of acousmatic sound.

243
00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:05.559
Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice
used to sing in rooms

244
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:09.442
up in galleries close to the ceiling,

245
00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:13.406
creating the illusion that we're listening
to angels up in the sky.

246
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.900
Richard Wagner famously
created the hidden orchestra

247
00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:21.760
that was placed in a pit
between the stage and the audience.

248
00:14:21.784 --> 00:14:26.827
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin,
famously hid in dark corners of clubs.

249
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.983
I think what all these masters knew
is that by hiding the source,

250
00:14:32.007 --> 00:14:33.670
you create a sense of mystery.

251
00:14:33.694 --> 00:14:35.763
This has been seen
in cinema over and over,

252
00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:38.867
with Hitchcock,
and Ridley Scott in "Alien."

253
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:41.283
Hearing a sound without knowing its source

254
00:14:41.307 --> 00:14:44.532
is going to create some sort of tension.

255
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:51.964
Also, it can minimize certain visual
restrictions that directors have

256
00:14:51.988 --> 00:14:55.678
and can show something
that wasn't there during filming.

257
00:14:55.702 --> 00:14:57.787
And if all this sounds
a little theoretical,

258
00:14:57.811 --> 00:15:00.217
I wanted to play a little video.

259
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.636
(Toy squeaks)

260
00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:06.854
(Typewriter)

261
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:10.087
(Drums)

262
00:15:10.984 --> 00:15:13.305
(Ping-pong)

263
00:15:14.304 --> 00:15:17.264
(Knives being sharpened)

264
00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:20.652
(Record scratches)

265
00:15:21.225 --> 00:15:22.411
(Saw cuts)

266
00:15:22.435 --> 00:15:23.892
(Woman screams)

267
00:15:24.483 --> 00:15:28.278
What I'm sort of trying
to demonstrate with these tools

268
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.939
is that sound is a language.

269
00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:35.478
It can trick us by transporting
us geographically;

270
00:15:36.391 --> 00:15:37.907
it can change the mood;

271
00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:39.820
it can set the pace;

272
00:15:41.302 --> 00:15:44.756
it can make us laugh
or it can make us scared.

273
00:15:46.518 --> 00:15:49.868
On a personal level, I fell
in love with that language

274
00:15:49.892 --> 00:15:51.209
a few years ago,

275
00:15:51.233 --> 00:15:55.840
and somehow managed to make it
into some sort of profession.

276
00:15:57.094 --> 00:16:00.320
And I think with our work
through the sound library,

277
00:16:00.344 --> 00:16:06.140
we're trying to kind of expand
the vocabulary of that language.

278
00:16:07.617 --> 00:16:11.099
And in that way, we want
to offer the right tools

279
00:16:11.123 --> 00:16:12.763
to sound designers,

280
00:16:12.787 --> 00:16:14.135
filmmakers,

281
00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:15.994
and video game and app designers,

282
00:16:16.568 --> 00:16:19.703
to keep telling even better stories

283
00:16:20.202 --> 00:16:22.934
and creating even more beautiful lies.

284
00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.245
So thanks for listening.

285
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:27.788
(Applause)

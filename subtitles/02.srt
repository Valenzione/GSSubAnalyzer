2
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,974
You've been reckless
this summer, Harry.

3
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,097
I like riding around
the trains.

4
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,071
Takes my mind
off things.

5
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:18,127
All unpleasant to be old,
isn't it?

6
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:21,289
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.

7
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,797
But now is not the time
to tell it.

8
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:25,559
Take my arm.

9
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:30,794
Do as I say.

10
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,601
I hardly just Apparated,
didn't I?

11
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:42,351
Indeed.

12
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:45,046
Quite successfully too,
I might add.

13
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:47,117
Most people vomit
the first time.

14
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:48,994
Can't imagine why.

15
00:01:57,053 --> 00:02:01,448
Welcome to the charming village
of Budleigh Babberton.

16
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:04,176
Harry, I assume right about now
you must be wondering...

17
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,602
why I brought you here?

18
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:06,927
Am I right?

19
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:10,355
Actually sir, after all these years,
I just, sort of, go with it.

20
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,833
Wands on, Harry.

21
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:29,700
Horace!

22
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:43,491
Horace.

23
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:37,580
Merlin's beard!

24
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,902
You don't need
to disfigure me, Albus.

25
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,009
Well I must say you made
a very convincing armchair, Horace.

26
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:47,729
It's all
in the upholstery.

27
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:50,246
I come by this stuffing naturally.
What gave me away?

28
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,094
Dragon's blood.

29
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,471
Oh yes, introductions.

30
00:03:56,506 --> 00:04:00,308
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine--

31
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,171
Horace Slughorn.

32
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:06,126
Horace...
Well you know who this is.

33
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:09,380
Harry Potter.

34
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,350
So for love of theatrics,
Horace...

35
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,072
You're, by any chance,
waiting for someone else, were you?

36
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:18,957
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

37
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:22,327
Alright. The Death Eaters
have been trying

38
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,582
to recruit me
for over a year.

39
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:24,879
Do you know
what's that like?

40
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,869
You can only say no
to these people so many times.

41
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:28,644
So I never stay anywhere
more than a week.

42
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:31,812
The Muggles who own this place
are in the Canary Islands.

43
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, I think we should put it
back in order for them,

44
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:35,034
- don't you?
- Yes.

45
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:35,627
Fine.

46
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:12,200
That was fun.

47
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,311
Do you mind
if I use the loo?

48
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:16,560
No, of course.

49
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:20,837
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

50
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:22,657
The answer is still no.

51
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:25,712
Absolutely,
and unequivanetly, no.

52
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,427
You're very like
your father.

53
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:39,223
Except the eyes,
of course.

54
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:40,990
- You have your--
- My mother's eyes, yeah.

55
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,666
Lily, lovely Lily.

56
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,682
She's exceedingly bright,
your mother.

57
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,649
Even more impressive
even though I could say

58
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,171
that she was Muggle-born.

59
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,426
One of my best friends
is Muggle-born.

60
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:52,046
- She's the best in our year.
- Oh please don't think

61
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:53,430
I'm prejudiced.
No, no, no.

62
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:56,482
Your mother was
one of my absolute favorites.

63
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:59,147
Look, there she is.
Right at the front.

64
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,778
All mine.
Each and every one.

65
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,804
Ex-students, I mean.

66
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:19,410
You recognise Barnabas Cuffe?
Editor of the Daily Prophet.

67
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:23,523
Always takes my owl
should I wish to register an opinion

68
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:24,666
on the news of the day.

69
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:28,654
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

70
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:30,561
Free tickets
whenever I want them.

71
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,938
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

72
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,317
Ah, yes!
Regulus Black.

73
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:42,333
No doubt, there is
his older brother Sirius,

74
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,819
died a few weeks ago.

75
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:47,274
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

76
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:48,228
It's a shame.

77
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,518
A talented boy.

78
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:51,746
I got Regulus when
he came along, of course, but...

79
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,745
but I'd like to set.

80
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:56,511
Horace!

81
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:58,854
Do you mind if I take this?

82
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,426
I do love
knitting patterns.

83
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,458
Yes, of course,
but you're not leaving, are you?

84
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,901
Oh, I think I know
a lost cause when I see one.

85
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:13,126
Regrettable, I would have considered it
a very personal triumph

86
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,314
if you consented
to return to Hogwarts.

87
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,099
Ah well, you're like my friend
Mr. Potter here.

88
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,544
One of a kind.

89
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:23,401
Well, bye-bye Horace.
Bye.

90
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,851
Alright. I'll do it.

91
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:39,836
But I want Professor Merrythought's
old office,

92
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:42,076
not the water closet
I had before.

93
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:43,581
And I expect a raise.

94
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,918
These are mad times
we're living, mad!

95
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,555
They are, indeed.

96
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:55,335
Sir, exactly what was
all that about?

97
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:58,558
You are talented,
famous and powerful.

98
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,405
Everything Horace values.

99
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,503
Professor Slughorn's gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

100
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:06,510
You would be
his crowning jewel.

101
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:08,974
That's why
he's returning to Hogwarts.

102
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,657
And it's crucial
he should return.

103
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:16,091
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

104
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:17,997
She was truthfully...

105
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,719
very pretty.

106
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:20,897
The girl.

107
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:22,534
It's alright, sir.

108
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,166
I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

109
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:27,939
Oh you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

110
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:31,741
But sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

111
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:34,299
Both
are waiting for you.

112
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,260
Hedwig?

113
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:13,199
Mom?

114
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,603
Ginny, what is it?

115
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:18,755
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

116
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:21,613
What?
Harry-- Harry, who?

117
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,800
Harry Potter, of course.

118
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:25,729
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

119
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,602
His trunk's in the kitchen...
and his owl.

120
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:30,117
But no, dear.
I seriously doubt that.

121
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,693
Harry?
Did someone say Harry?

122
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,203
Me, nosey.
Is he up there with you?

123
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:36,845
Of course not.

124
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,288
I think I'll know if my best friend's
in my room, wouldn't I?

125
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:40,781
Is that an owl I heard?

126
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:42,054
You haven't seen him,
have you?

127
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:43,892
Apparently, he's wandering
about the house.

128
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:45,657
- Really?
- Really.

129
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:46,926
Harry!

130
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:54,797
Harry.

131
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:01,386
What a lovely surprise!

132
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:05,040
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

133
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:06,647
I didn't know.
Dumbledore.

134
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:09,917
Oh, that man!
What we won't do without him?

135
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,920
A bit of... toothpaste.

136
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:22,586
So when did you
get here?

137
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,172
A few days ago.

138
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:27,655
Day or for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

139
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,894
Mum...
sort of lost it, last week.

140
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:35,108
Said Ginny and I have
no business going back to Hogwarts.

141
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,968
It's too dangerous.

142
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,413
Oh, come on.

143
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:39,599
She's not alone.

144
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:41,448
Even my parents.
They're Muggles,

145
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:42,832
know something
bad's happening.

146
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:45,274
Anyway,
Dad stepped in.

147
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:47,156
Told us she was
being barmy and...

148
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,557
Took a few days,
but she came around.

149
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,983
But, this is Hogwarts
we're talking about.

150
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:54,667
It's Dumbledore.
What could be safer?

151
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,607
There's been a lot of talk
recently that...

152
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,398
Dumbledore's
got a bit old.

153
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,329
What rubbish!
Well, he's only...

154
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,766
How old is he?

155
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:09,161
150?
Give or take a few years?

156
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,884
Cissy, you can't do this!

157
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,279
He can't be trusted.

158
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,324
The Dark Lord trusts him.

159
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:36,501
The Dark Lord is mistaken.

160
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:09,562
Run along, Wormtail.

161
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:14,353
I-I know
I ought not to be here.

162
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,161
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

163
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,978
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you would not to speak.

164
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:25,322
Put it down, Bella, we mustn't
touch what isn't ours.

165
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:34,243
As it, so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

166
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:35,095
You?

167
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,444
The Dark Lord told you?

168
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:41,171
Your sister darts me.

169
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:45,967
Understandable, over the years,
I've played my part well.

170
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:50,031
So well, I've deceived one of
the greatest wizards of all time.

171
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,056
Dumbledore <i>is</i> a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

172
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,119
I don't doubt you, Severus.

173
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:58,508
You should be honored,
Cissy.

174
00:12:58,543 --> 00:12:59,723
As should Draco.

175
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,214
He's just a boy.

176
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,799
I can't change
the Dark Lord's mind.

177
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,419
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

178
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,718
Severus.

179
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:20,080
Swear to it.

180
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:26,563
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

181
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:33,414
It's just empty words.

182
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:39,442
You'll give it his best effort...
when it matters most.

183
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:44,834
He'll just slither back
to his hole.

184
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,040
Coward.

185
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:56,995
Take out your wand.

186
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:17,316
Will you, Severus Snape,
watch over Draco Malfoy

187
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:21,322
as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

188
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:24,141
I will.

189
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,401
And will you,
to the best of your ability,

190
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:32,596
protect him from harm?

191
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:35,325
I will.

192
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:40,286
And if Draco should fail,

193
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,982
will you yourself
carry out the deed

194
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:50,406
the Dark Lord has ordered
Draco to perform?

195
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,427
I will.

196
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:23,691
Step up, step up!
We got fating fancies.

197
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:26,455
- And he's made me go.
- At just in for time for school.

198
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,680
Puking Pastilles.

199
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,513
Meeting's in the cauldron,
Hanson.

200
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:49,231
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- How real many spinned it at that one?

201
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:51,027
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

202
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,607
Hello, ladies.
Love potions, eh?

203
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,019
Yeah.
They really do work.

204
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:58,535
Then again the way
we heard you, sis...

205
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,175
You're doing just fine
on your own.

206
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,059
Meaning?

207
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,447
Are you not currently dating
Dean Thomas?

208
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,318
It's none of your business.

209
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:12,615
How much for this?

210
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,187
- Five galleons.
- Five galleons.

211
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:15,343
How much for me?

212
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:16,881
- Five galleons.
- Five galleons.

213
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,869
I'm your brother.

214
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:19,494
- Ten galleons.
- Ten galleons.

215
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:23,375
Come on, let's go.

216
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,195
Hi, Ron.

217
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,313
Hi.

218
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,929
How are Fred and George
doing it?

219
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,483
Half the alley's
closed down.

220
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,283
Fred reckons people
need a laugh these days.

221
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:51,607
I reckon he's right.

222
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:55,224
Oh, no.

223
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,463
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivanders.

224
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:11,740
Harry...

225
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:15,587
Is it me
or do Draco and Mummy

226
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:17,584
look like two people who
don't want to be followed?

227
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:04,111
<i>Quibbler!</i>

228
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:07,269
Quibbler.

229
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:10,928
He's lovely.

230
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:13,836
They've been known to sing
at Boxing Day, you know?

231
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:16,661
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.

232
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:19,480
What's a Wrackspurt?

233
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:20,913
Invisible creatures,

234
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,315
they flow in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

235
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:25,452
Quibbler!

236
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,350
So what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

237
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:41,053
And who were
all those people?

238
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,434
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony.

239
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:45,759
- An initiation.
- Stop it, Harry.

240
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:47,823
- I know where you're going with this.
- It happened.

241
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:50,281
- He's one of them.
- One of who?

242
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:55,122
Harry's under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

243
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:56,490
You're barking.

244
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,481
What would You-Know-Who want
with a sod like Malfoy?

245
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:01,800
Oh, then what's he doing
in Borgin and Burkes?

246
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,315
Browsing for furniture?

247
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,992
It's a creepy shop.
He's a creepy blood.

248
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:09,689
Blood? His father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

249
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,898
Besides, Hermione saw it
with her own eyes.

250
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:14,431
I told you,
I don't know what I saw.

251
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:17,876
I need some air.

252
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,460
- What's going on?
- What's in that?

253
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:00,077
What's that?

254
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,471
What is it?

255
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,776
- I don't know.
- What was that?

256
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:05,393
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a phantom messing around.

257
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:08,775
Come, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

258
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,285
You two go on.

259
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:16,207
Wanna check something.

260
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:21,668
- Where's Harry?
- He's probably on the platform.

261
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:22,765
Come on.

262
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:42,579
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

263
00:21:42,614 --> 00:21:44,213
Petrificus Totalus!

264
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:56,437
Oh yeah...

265
00:21:57,284 --> 00:22:00,176
She was dead before you could
wipe the drool off your chin.

266
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,628
That's for my father.

267
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,611
Enjoy your ride
back to London.

268
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:54,251
Ennervate!

269
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:01,962
Hello, Harry!

270
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:03,954
Luna.
How'd you know where I was?

271
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:06,817
Wrackspurts,
your head's full of them.

272
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,619
Sorry I made you miss the carriages,
by the way, Luna.

273
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:19,802
That's alright.
It was like being with a friend.

274
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:21,439
Well,
I am your friend, Luna.

275
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:23,620
That's nice.

276
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,852
Oh, about time.

277
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,649
I've been looking
all over for you two.

278
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:30,112
Right...
Names?

279
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:33,232
Professor Flitwick,
you know me for five years.

280
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:35,677
No exceptions, Potter.

281
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:39,047
- Who are those people?
- Aurors.

282
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:40,733
Security.

283
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:42,320
What's this cane here then?

284
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,970
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

285
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:47,019
And what exactly will
you be doing with all...

286
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:53,073
be construed
as an offensive weapon.

287
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:58,110
It's alright, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

288
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,233
Nice face, Potter.

289
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,119
Would you like me
to fix it for you?

290
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,836
Personally, I think
you look a bit more...

291
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:20,782
devil may care
this way but...

292
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:21,744
It's up to you.

293
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,429
Well, have you ever
fixed a nose before?

294
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:27,280
No, but I've done
several toes...

295
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:29,102
How different
are they really?

296
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,246
Um, okay, yeah.
Give it a go.

297
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:37,313
Episkey!

298
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:48,155
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

299
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:49,544
Brilliant!

300
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:58,541
Hermione...

301
00:24:58,752 --> 00:24:59,914
I'm here in a minute.

302
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:08,184
Will you stop eating?
Your best friend is missing.

303
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:11,602
Why won't you
turn around, you lunatic?

304
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,553
He's covered in blood again.

305
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,653
Why is it
he's always covered in blood?

306
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:20,675
Looks like it's his own
this time.

307
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:24,448
Where have you been?
What happened to your face?

308
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,195
Later.

309
00:25:25,978 --> 00:25:26,831
What did I miss?

310
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:31,305
The Sorting Hat says we ought to be
brave and strong in these trouble times.

311
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,891
Easy for it to say, though.
It's a hat, isn't it?

312
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:45,707
- Very best of evenings to you all.
- Thanks.

313
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:52,736
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff.

314
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,987
Horace Slughorn.

315
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:03,525
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say,
has agreed to resume his old post...

316
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:05,307
as Potions Master.

317
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,790
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

318
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,248
will be taken by
Professor Snape.

319
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,350
As you know,
each and every one of you

320
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:23,695
were searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

321
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:26,100
And you have the right
to know why.

322
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:29,342
Once,
there was a young man.

323
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:32,893
Like you,
sat in this very hall.

324
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,936
Walked this castle's corridors.

325
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:37,915
Slept under it's roof.

326
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:42,820
You see, to all the world,
a student like any other.

327
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:44,550
His name:

328
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:47,946
Tom Riddle.

329
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:58,045
Today of course, is known
all over the world by another name.

330
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,414
Which is why
as I stand,

331
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:04,123
looking out
upon you all tonight,

332
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,177
I'm reminded
of a sobering fact.

333
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:13,631
Every day, every hour,
this very minute, perhaps...

334
00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:17,827
dark forces attempt
to penetrate this castle's walls.

335
00:27:19,978 --> 00:27:23,772
But in the end,
that greatest weapon...

336
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,118
is you.

337
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:29,930
Just something
to think about.

338
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,476
Now off to bed,
beep beep.

339
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:36,279
That was cheerful.

340
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:46,391
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

341
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:52,433
Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis,
that is the girls' lavatory.

342
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:56,421
Potter.

343
00:27:58,191 --> 00:27:59,777
Oh, this can't be good.

344
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,234
Enjoying ourselves,
are we?

345
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,767
I had a free period
this morning, Professor.

346
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:08,990
So I noticed.

347
00:28:09,673 --> 00:28:11,982
I would think you would want
to fill it with Potions.

348
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:15,172
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

349
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:19,113
Well, it was, but I was told to have
to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L.

350
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:22,525
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

351
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,023
However, Professor Slughorn's
perfectly happy

352
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:29,495
to accept N.E.W.T. students
with "Exceeds Expectations".

353
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,466
Brilliant, um...
Well, I'll head there straight away.

354
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:33,427
Oh, good, good.

355
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:38,257
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

356
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:41,999
I don't want
to take Potions.

357
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,109
There's Quidditch trials coming up,
I need to practice.

358
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:50,614
Attention to detail in the preparation
is the prerequisite of all plan.

359
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,532
Harry, my boy,
I've been beginning to worry.

360
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,508
You brought someone
with us, I see.

361
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,582
Ron Weasley, sir.

362
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,439
But I'm dead awful at Potions.
A menace, actually so.

363
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,466
I'm probably just gonna--

364
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:04,865
Nonsense,
we'll sort you out.

365
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:06,732
Any friend of Harry's
is a friend of mine.

366
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:07,537
Get your books out.

367
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:10,593
I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually
got my book yet and nor is Ron.

368
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,425
Not to worry,
get what you want from the cupboard.

369
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,662
Now as I was saying,

370
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:15,949
I prepared some concoctions
this morning.

371
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:20,135
Any ideas
what these might be?

372
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:23,528
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

373
00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:29,454
That one there is
Veritaserum.

374
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,398
It's a truth-telling serum.

375
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:33,208
And that one--

376
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:41,385
It's terribly tricky to make.
This is Amortentia.

377
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:44,100
The most powerful
love potion in the world.

378
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:47,674
It's rumored to smell differently
to each person

379
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:48,880
according to
what attracts them.

380
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:52,198
For example, I smell...

381
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:57,060
Freshly mown grass
and new parchment and...

382
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:00,756
Spearmint toothpaste.

383
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:05,439
Now Amortentia
doesn't create actual love.

384
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:06,227
That would be impossible,

385
00:30:06,257 --> 00:30:11,052
but it does cause
powerful infatuation or obsession.

386
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:12,613
And for that reason,

387
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:17,608
it is probably the most
dangerous potion in this room.

388
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:26,216
Sir, you haven't told us
what's in that one.

389
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:31,112
Oh yes. What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen,

390
00:30:31,147 --> 00:30:33,501
is a curious little potion,

391
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:36,146
known as Felix Felicis.

392
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:39,573
But it is more commonly known
referred to as--

393
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,221
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger.

394
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:44,445
Liquid luck.

395
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:48,458
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

396
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:53,603
One sip and you'll find
that all of your endeavours succeed.

397
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,348
At least
until the effects wear off.

398
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:02,780
So this is what I offer
each of you today.

399
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:06,687
One tiny vial of liquid luck
to the student

400
00:31:06,722 --> 00:31:09,398
who in the hour that remains,
manages to brew

401
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:12,298
an acceptable
Draught of Living Dead.

402
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:16,076
Recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

403
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,042
Issue one doubt, however.

404
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,663
Only one set of student
manage to brew a potion

405
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:23,020
of sufficient quality
to claim this prize.

406
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:26,653
Nevertheless,
good luck to you all.

407
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:29,015
Let the brewing commence.

408
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:06,385
How did you do that?

409
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:08,990
You crush it,
don't cut it.

410
00:32:09,673 --> 00:32:12,599
No, the instructions
specifically says to cut.

411
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,644
No, really.

412
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:53,827
Merlin's beard!

413
00:32:53,862 --> 00:32:55,162
It is perfect!

414
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:59,095
So perfect I'd just say
one drop would kill us all!

415
00:33:02,728 --> 00:33:05,117
Here we are then,
as promised.

416
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,066
One vial of Felix Felicis.

417
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,973
Congratulations.

418
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:13,199
Use it well.

419
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:42,815
Oh Harry,
you got my message?

420
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,774
Come in.

421
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:46,484
How are you?

422
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:47,986
I'm fine, sir.

423
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,374
Enjoying your classes?

424
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,953
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

425
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,530
I think he overestimates
my abilities, sir.

426
00:33:58,182 --> 00:33:58,958
Do you?

427
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:00,775
Definitely.

428
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:05,662
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

429
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:07,729
Sir?

430
00:34:07,764 --> 00:34:11,798
Well, I notice you've spent
a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

431
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,490
I can't help wondering if--

432
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:14,906
Oh, no, no, I mean...

433
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,090
She's brilliant
and we're friends.

434
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:19,136
- But no.
- Forgive me.

435
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:21,235
I was only being curious.

436
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,142
But enough chit-chat.

437
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:27,788
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

438
00:34:28,872 --> 00:34:31,246
The answer lies here.

439
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,616
What you're looking at
are memories.

440
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,381
In this case,
pertaining to one individual:

441
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:38,795
Voldemort.

442
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:41,506
Or as he was known, then:
Tom Riddle.

443
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:47,593
This vial contains
the most particular memory.

444
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,284
On the day
I first met him.

445
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:54,740
I'd like you to see it.
If you want.

446
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:36,634
I'm to admit to some confusion for
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

447
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:40,577
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

448
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:43,185
There have been incidents
with the other children--

449
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,560
Nasty things.

450
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:48,881
Tom, you have a visitor.

451
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:50,927
How'd you do, Tom?

452
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,723
Don't.

453
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:09,460
You're the doctor,
aren't you?

454
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:12,676
No, I'm a professor.

455
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,185
I don't believe you.

456
00:36:15,888 --> 00:36:17,484
She wants me
looked at.

457
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:20,969
They think I'm...
different.

458
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,294
Or perhaps they're right.

459
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,016
I'm not mad.

460
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:27,008
Hogwarts is not a place
for mad people.

461
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:29,238
Hogwarts is a school.

462
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,726
School of magic.

463
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:38,340
You can do things,
can't you, Tom?

464
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:42,190
Things other children can't.

465
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:46,464
I can make things move
without touching them.

466
00:36:47,848 --> 00:36:50,878
I can make animals do
what I want without training them.

467
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:55,247
I can make bad things happen
to people who mean to me.

468
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,902
Can make them hurt.

469
00:36:58,977 --> 00:36:59,948
If I want.

470
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,269
Who are you?

471
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,809
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

472
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:07,985
I'm different.

473
00:37:08,908 --> 00:37:10,033
Prove it.

474
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:19,884
I think there's something
in your wardrobe

475
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,214
trying to get out, Tom.

476
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:34,460
Thievery is not tolerated
at Hogwarts, Tom.

477
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:40,414
At Hogwarts, we'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

478
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:42,522
You understand me?

479
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:48,408
I can speak to snakes too.

480
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:51,570
They find me.

481
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:57,809
Whisper things.
Is that normal for someone like me?

482
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:22,432
Did you know, sir,
then?

483
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,333
Did I know I just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time?

484
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:27,855
No.

485
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,889
If I had, I...

486
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:34,531
Over time
while here at Hogwarts,

487
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:38,243
Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

488
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:40,697
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

489
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,292
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach potions, did you, sir?

490
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,526
No, I did not.

491
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:53,453
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something that I desire very dearly.

492
00:38:54,317 --> 00:38:56,202
He will not
give it out easily.

493
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:59,069
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect to me.

494
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:00,483
I did.

495
00:39:01,847 --> 00:39:03,262
Do you want me
to let him?

496
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:05,862
Yes.

497
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:33,796
Okay,
so this morning,

498
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,663
I'm gonna be putting you all
for a few drills

499
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:37,122
just to assess you
straight.

500
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,648
Quiet, please!

501
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:41,807
Shut it!

502
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:46,472
Thanks.

503
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:49,445
Alright, um,
now then, remember,

504
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,902
just because you made
the team last year

505
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:52,767
does not guarantee you
a spot this year.

506
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:53,608
Is that clear?

507
00:40:56,265 --> 00:40:57,080
Good.

508
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,039
- No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?
- Hard feelings?

509
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:11,934
Yeah, I'll be going out
for Keeper's, well,

510
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,541
It's...
nothing personal.

511
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,045
Really?

512
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:16,725
Such a big guy like you?

513
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,879
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

514
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,989
Keepers need
to be quick, agile.

515
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,069
I'll have my chances.

516
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,806
Say, um, you think you could
introduce me to your friend, Granger?

517
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,029
Wouldn't mind, eh,
getting on a first-hand base,

518
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:33,214
you know
what I mean?

519
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:47,956
Come on, come on.

520
00:41:53,968 --> 00:41:55,543
Go, Cormac.

521
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:13,371
Come on, Ron!

522
00:42:24,696 --> 00:42:25,681
Come on, Ron.

523
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,433
Confundus.

524
00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:03,261
He's brilliant.

525
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,394
I have to admit I thought
I was going to miss that last one.

526
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,705
I hope Cormac's
not taking it too hard.

527
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:16,085
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione-- Cormac.

528
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,066
He's vile.

529
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:27,342
Have you ever heard of the spell:
Sectumsempra?

530
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:28,756
No, I haven't.

531
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:32,116
If you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

532
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,050
Not bloody likely.

533
00:43:34,085 --> 00:43:36,820
He's top of the class.
He's even better than you, Hermione.

534
00:43:37,383 --> 00:43:38,867
Slughorn thinks
he's a genius.

535
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,467
I'd like to know
who's that book was.

536
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,382
- Let's have a look, shall we?
- No.

537
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,433
Why not?

538
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:51,943
The binding is fragile.

539
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,683
- "The binding is fragile"?
- Yeah.

540
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,889
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

541
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:02,170
That's what it says
right here.

542
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:04,200
This book is property
of the Half-Blood Prince.

543
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,260
<i>For weeks,
you carry around this book.</i>

544
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,545
<i>Practically, sleep with it,
and yet you have no desire</i>

545
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,011
<i>to find out
who the Half-Blood Prince is.</i>

546
00:44:28,046 --> 00:44:31,273
I didn't say I wasn't curious
and I don't sleep with it.

547
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:32,491
Well, it's true.

548
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:34,503
Well, I got a nice chat
before I go to bed.

549
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,965
And all you do is that bloody book.
It's like being with Hermione.

550
00:44:40,023 --> 00:44:42,763
Well, I was curious
So, I went to--

551
00:44:42,803 --> 00:44:43,713
- The library?
- The library?

552
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:44,473
And?

553
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:49,082
And nothing.
I couldn't find a reference

554
00:44:49,117 --> 00:44:51,190
anywhere
to the Half-Blood Prince.

555
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:52,495
There we go.
That settles it, then.

556
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:53,589
Yeah, uh...

557
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,576
hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks.

558
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:59,896
Uh no, emergency choir practice
from the freighthorse.

559
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:05,554
Does anyone fancy
a butterbeer?

560
00:45:06,618 --> 00:45:08,061
A chum of mine
was sledging down Clagsby Hill.

561
00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:12,858
We had a very long, home-made
Norwegian style sledge.

562
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,568
We hurtled down,
we hit what most...

563
00:45:17,377 --> 00:45:18,591
Katie, we don't know
what it could be.

564
00:45:18,868 --> 00:45:20,474
- Harry, what...
- I know what I'm doing.

565
00:45:20,504 --> 00:45:21,559
Did you hear
what she was saying

566
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,088
back in the pub there
on me and her snogging?

567
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:36,238
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

568
00:45:57,912 --> 00:45:58,996
Don't get any closer!

569
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,115
Get back, all of you.

570
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:05,948
Oh no, no, no.

571
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,776
Do not touch that,
except for the wrappings.

572
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:17,383
Do you understand?

573
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:34,138
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession

574
00:46:34,173 --> 00:46:36,125
when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

575
00:46:37,084 --> 00:46:38,077
It's like I said.

576
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,506
She left to go to the loo.

577
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:43,456
And when she came back,
she had the package.

578
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:47,639
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

579
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:51,622
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

580
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,636
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

581
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,370
Why is it
when something happens,

582
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:05,338
it is always you three?

583
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:07,855
Believe me, Professor,

584
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,274
I've been asking myself
the same question for six years.

585
00:47:11,271 --> 00:47:12,665
Oh, Severus.

586
00:47:18,893 --> 00:47:19,859
What do you think?

587
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:26,806
I think Ms. Bell
is lucky to be alive.

588
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,014
She was cursed,
wasn't she?

589
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:30,725
I know Katie.

590
00:47:30,755 --> 00:47:32,809
Off the Quidditch pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

591
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:35,220
If she was delivering that
to Professor Dumbledore,

592
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,725
she wasn't doing it
knowingly.

593
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,422
Yes, she was cursed.

594
00:47:39,486 --> 00:47:40,462
It was Malfoy.

595
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:46,111
That is a very
serious accusation, Potter.

596
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:50,547
Indeed.
Your evidence?

597
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:52,293
I just know.

598
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:57,757
You "just" know.

599
00:48:01,057 --> 00:48:03,235
Once again, you astonish
with your gifts, Potter.

600
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:07,300
Gifts mere mortals can only
dream of possessing.

601
00:48:07,335 --> 00:48:12,859
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

602
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:20,457
I suggest you go back
to your dormitories.

603
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:21,379
All of you.

604
00:48:32,072 --> 00:48:35,458
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your uncle Tiberius these days?

605
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:39,040
Yes, sir, in fact I'm meant
to go hunting with him

606
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:40,384
and the Minister of Magic
over the holidays.

607
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:43,737
Oh, well, be sure
to give them both my best.

608
00:48:43,772 --> 00:48:46,335
And what about
your uncle, Belby?

609
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,786
For those of you
who don't know well,

610
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:50,058
Marcus' uncle invented
the Wolfsbane Potion.

611
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,754
Is he working
on anything new?

612
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:52,226
I don't.

613
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:54,173
He and my dad
don't get along.

614
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:56,622
'Prolly cause my dad
says potions are rubbish.

615
00:48:57,254 --> 00:49:00,384
His only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

616
00:49:00,419 --> 00:49:01,637
And what about you,
Ms. Granger,

617
00:49:01,678 --> 00:49:04,918
what exactly does your family do
in the Muggle world?

618
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:08,293
My parents are dentists.

619
00:49:12,768 --> 00:49:15,657
- They attend to people's teeth.
- Fascinating.

620
00:49:16,591 --> 00:49:19,267
And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

621
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:20,149
No.

622
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:26,934
Although, one boy, Robby Fenwich,
did bite my father once.

623
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:28,907
He needed ten stitches.

624
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,801
Ah, Ms. Weasley.
Come in, come in.

625
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:44,078
Look, her eyes.
They've been fighting again.

626
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:45,130
Her and Dean.

627
00:49:45,475 --> 00:49:47,487
Sorry,
I'm not usually late.

628
00:49:51,801 --> 00:49:54,580
No matter,
just in time for dessert.

629
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:56,760
That is if Belby
has left you any.

630
00:50:04,355 --> 00:50:06,550
- What?
- Nothing.

631
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:14,776
Goodbye.

632
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:16,686
Bye-bye.

633
00:50:22,196 --> 00:50:22,776
Potter!

634
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,794
I'm sorry, sir, I was
just admiring your hourglass.

635
00:50:28,078 --> 00:50:31,621
Ah yes,
most intriguing object.

636
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:36,186
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

637
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,944
It is stimulating,
the sand runs slowly.

638
00:50:41,244 --> 00:50:43,325
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going, then.

639
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,199
Nonsense.

640
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,286
You have nothing
to fear, dear boy.

641
00:50:46,698 --> 00:50:48,415
Actually,
some of your classmates...

642
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:52,045
Well, let's just say
they're unlikely to make the shelf.

643
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:53,459
Shelf, sir?

644
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:58,123
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

645
00:50:58,674 --> 00:51:01,746
But then again, you already
are someone, aren't you, Harry?

646
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,657
Did Voldemort
ever make the shelf, sir?

647
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:09,973
You knew him, didn't you, sir?
Tom Riddle?

648
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:11,382
You were his teacher.

649
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,255
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
who was here at Hogwarts.

650
00:51:16,632 --> 00:51:17,948
What was he like?

651
00:51:21,887 --> 00:51:23,784
I'm sorry, sir.
Forgive me.

652
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:26,484
He killed my parents.

653
00:51:29,244 --> 00:51:33,529
Of course, it's only natural
you should want to know more.

654
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:38,578
But I'm afraid
I must disappoint you, Harry.

655
00:51:39,936 --> 00:51:41,800
When I first met
young Mr. Riddle,

656
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:43,887
he was a quiet,
albeit brilliant boy,

657
00:51:43,922 --> 00:51:46,127
committed to becoming
a first-grade wizard.

658
00:51:46,878 --> 00:51:48,770
Not unlike
others I've known.

659
00:51:49,154 --> 00:51:50,937
Not unlike yourself,
in fact.

660
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:57,007
If the monster existed,
it was very deep within.

661
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,685
You okay, Ron?

662
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:23,066
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I've 2 games on Gryffindor, ya?

663
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:25,674
- Be good, Ron.
- Loser!

664
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:28,899
What's he wearing?

665
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:42,266
- So how was it, then?
- How is what?

666
00:52:42,301 --> 00:52:45,277
- Your dinner party?
- Pretty boring actually.

667
00:52:46,446 --> 00:52:47,759
But I think
Harry enjoyed dessert.

668
00:52:51,813 --> 00:52:54,071
Slughorn's having Christmas,
do you know?

669
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:56,479
I'm about to bring someone.

670
00:52:56,514 --> 00:52:58,109
I expect
you'll be bringing McLaggen.

671
00:52:58,144 --> 00:52:59,548
He's in the Slug Club,
isn't he?

672
00:53:00,562 --> 00:53:02,038
Actually,
I was going to ask you.

673
00:53:02,436 --> 00:53:03,399
Really?

674
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,784
Good luck today, Ron.

675
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:10,835
I know
you'll be brilliant.

676
00:53:14,308 --> 00:53:15,479
I'm resigning.

677
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:18,385
After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

678
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,245
Are you alright?

679
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:22,068
- Juice?
- Sure.

680
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:23,994
Hello, everyone.

681
00:53:25,696 --> 00:53:27,046
You look dreadful, Ron.

682
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,556
Is that why you put
something in his cup?

683
00:53:32,348 --> 00:53:33,950
Is it a tonic?

684
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:38,562
Liquid luck.

685
00:53:40,488 --> 00:53:41,805
Don't drink it, Ron.

686
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:52,237
- You could be expelled for that.
- What are we talking about?

687
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,237
Come on, Harry,
we've got a game to win.

688
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:23,093
- Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
- Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

689
00:55:28,113 --> 00:55:29,332
You shouldn't
have done it.

690
00:55:30,177 --> 00:55:34,208
I know. I supposed I could have just
used the Confundus charm.

691
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:37,293
That was different.

692
00:55:37,825 --> 00:55:39,963
That was try-outs,
this was a natural game.

693
00:55:43,184 --> 00:55:44,391
You didn't put in?

694
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:48,181
Ron only thought
you did.

695
00:56:36,194 --> 00:56:39,176
Charm spell.
Just practising.

696
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:44,997
Very good.

697
00:56:50,857 --> 00:56:52,404
How does it feel, Harry?

698
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,139
When you see
Dean with Ginny?

699
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:04,782
I know.

700
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,200
I see the way
you look at her.

701
00:57:09,354 --> 00:57:10,838
You're my best friend.

702
00:57:20,254 --> 00:57:25,044
Oops! I think
this room's taken.

703
00:57:27,503 --> 00:57:28,656
What's with the birds?

704
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:33,278
Oppugno.

705
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:03,223
It feels like this.

706
00:58:43,564 --> 00:58:45,498
I can't help it if
she's got her knickers in a twist.

707
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:50,168
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say,

708
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:51,548
there's no stopping it.

709
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:52,875
It's chemical.

710
00:58:53,468 --> 00:58:55,535
Will it last?
Who knows?

711
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,439
Point is
I'm a free agent.

712
00:58:57,908 --> 00:59:00,649
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whomever he likes.

713
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:02,647
I really couldn't
care less.

714
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:04,664
Was I
under the impression

715
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:07,170
he and I would be attending
Slughorn's Christmas party together?

716
00:59:07,466 --> 00:59:11,443
Yes. Now,
given the circumstances,

717
00:59:11,478 --> 00:59:13,160
I had to make
other arrangements.

718
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:16,036
- Have you?
- Yes.

719
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:16,829
Why?

720
00:59:17,331 --> 00:59:19,499
Well, I just thought
seeing is not the risk at going

721
00:59:19,534 --> 00:59:20,582
with who
we'd really like to.

722
00:59:20,817 --> 00:59:22,892
We should go together,
as friends.

723
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:24,971
Why didn't
I think of that?

724
00:59:25,209 --> 00:59:26,315
Who are you going with?

725
00:59:26,976 --> 00:59:28,562
Um, it's a surprise.

726
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:32,292
Anyways, you have got to worry about.
You can't take anyone.

727
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:35,293
You see that girl
over there?

728
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:39,686
That's Romilda Vane.

729
00:59:39,721 --> 00:59:41,812
Harry, she's been been trying
to smuggle you a love potion.

730
00:59:42,353 --> 00:59:42,981
Really?

731
00:59:44,596 --> 00:59:45,229
Hey!

732
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:48,050
She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

733
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,545
But I am
the Chosen One.

734
00:59:50,073 --> 00:59:51,658
Okay, sorry, um...

735
00:59:52,562 --> 00:59:53,186
Kidding.

736
00:59:54,881 --> 00:59:56,469
I'll ask someone I like.

737
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,265
Someone cool.

738
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:10,889
I've never been
to this part of the castle.

739
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:13,119
At least,
not while awake.

740
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:14,684
I sleep-walk, you see.

741
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:16,846
That's why
I wear shoes to bed.

742
01:00:48,759 --> 01:00:50,675
Harmonia nictere passus.

743
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,513
Harmonia nictere passus.

744
01:01:08,412 --> 01:01:10,679
Harmonia nictere passus.

745
01:01:25,901 --> 01:01:26,587
Drink?

746
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:29,133
Neville.

747
01:01:29,654 --> 01:01:31,096
I didn't get
into the Slug Club.

748
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:32,600
It's okay, though.

749
01:01:32,635 --> 01:01:34,501
He's got Melvin hanging up
towels in the looroom.

750
01:01:34,536 --> 01:01:35,968
I'm--I'm fine, mate.
Thanks.

751
01:01:36,003 --> 01:01:36,589
Okay.

752
01:01:47,973 --> 01:01:49,621
Hermione,
what are you doing?

753
01:01:49,891 --> 01:01:50,742
What happened to you?

754
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:52,292
No, I've just escaped.

755
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:56,379
I mean, I left Cormac
under the mistletoe.

756
01:01:56,414 --> 01:01:58,858
Cormac?
That's who you invited?

757
01:01:59,847 --> 01:02:01,630
I thought it would
annoy Ron the most.

758
01:02:03,145 --> 01:02:05,091
Thank you very much.
We will catch up with you.

759
01:02:05,126 --> 01:02:07,410
He's got more tentacles
than a Snargaluff plant.

760
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,450
- Dragon tails?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

761
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:13,120
Just this one.
They give one horribly bad breath.

762
01:02:13,382 --> 01:02:16,866
On second thoughts,
it might keep Cormac away.

763
01:02:18,606 --> 01:02:20,011
God, here he comes.

764
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:25,822
I think she just went
to paddle her nose.

765
01:02:26,152 --> 01:02:28,247
She's a little minx,
your friend.

766
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:30,374
Nice to work.
How nasty isn't she?

767
01:02:30,409 --> 01:02:31,819
Yeah, yeah,
yeah.

768
01:02:34,228 --> 01:02:35,396
What is this I'm eating,
by the way?

769
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:38,405
Dragon balls.

770
01:02:50,092 --> 01:02:53,709
You've just brought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

771
01:02:53,744 --> 01:02:56,788
Not so quick, Potter.

772
01:02:58,785 --> 01:03:01,998
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date--

773
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:06,490
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

774
01:03:06,525 --> 01:03:08,726
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

775
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,759
- Message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

776
01:03:11,794 --> 01:03:15,850
He asked me to give you his best
and he hopes you enjoy your holidays.

777
01:03:15,885 --> 01:03:18,037
He...
He's travelling.

778
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:22,652
And he won't return
until term resumes.

779
01:03:22,956 --> 01:03:23,908
Travelling where?

780
01:03:27,008 --> 01:03:28,041
How are you?

781
01:03:32,557 --> 01:03:34,602
Get your hands off me,
you filthy Squibb.

782
01:03:35,707 --> 01:03:37,052
Professor Slughorn, sir.

783
01:03:37,633 --> 01:03:41,473
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

784
01:03:41,868 --> 01:03:44,140
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

785
01:03:44,201 --> 01:03:45,775
Okay, okay,
I was gate-crashing.

786
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,168
Happy?

787
01:03:47,688 --> 01:03:50,775
I'll escort him out.

788
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,209
Certainly, Professor.

789
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:04,273
Alright, everyone carry on,
carry on.

790
01:04:06,906 --> 01:04:09,543
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't.

791
01:04:10,176 --> 01:04:10,890
What about you?

792
01:04:11,668 --> 01:04:16,874
I swore to protect you.
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

793
01:04:17,893 --> 01:04:19,528
I don't need protection.

794
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:21,760
I was chosen
for this.

795
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:23,206
I don't know
what all this mean,

796
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,991
- but I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

797
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,715
You attempt to consider,
but it's obvious,

798
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,844
- let me assist you.
- No.

799
01:04:35,048 --> 01:04:37,919
I was chosen.
This is my moment.

800
01:04:50,936 --> 01:04:54,068
Unbreakable Vow.
You sure that's what Snape said?

801
01:04:54,409 --> 01:04:56,786
Positive. Why?

802
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,837
It's just, you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

803
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:03,357
I-I worked that much out
for myself, funny enough.

804
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:05,512
I don't understand.

805
01:05:07,146 --> 01:05:08,202
Oh bloody hell.

806
01:05:35,757 --> 01:05:37,089
I miss you.

807
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:40,035
Lovely.

808
01:05:41,068 --> 01:05:42,727
All she wants to do
is snog me.

809
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:44,550
My lips
are getting chapped, look.

810
01:05:44,585 --> 01:05:45,900
Then I'll take
your word for it.

811
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:58,090
So what happens
to you?

812
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,979
What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

813
01:06:02,435 --> 01:06:03,438
You die.

814
01:06:11,562 --> 01:06:15,215
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

815
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,231
- I know it sounds mad.
- Has it occured to you, Harry,

816
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:20,221
that Snape was simply pretending
to offer Draco help

817
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:21,661
so he could find out
what he was up to?

818
01:06:21,696 --> 01:06:22,640
Ginny!

819
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:23,888
That's not
what it sounded like.

820
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:25,543
Perhaps Harry
is right, Remus.

821
01:06:26,246 --> 01:06:27,878
I mean to make
an Unbreakable Vow--

822
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:31,889
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgement.

823
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:34,629
Dumbledore trusts Snape,
therefore, I do.

824
01:06:34,664 --> 01:06:35,856
Dumbledore
can make mistakes.

825
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,370
- He said so himself.
- You are blinded by hatred.

826
01:06:37,405 --> 01:06:38,653
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

827
01:06:41,222 --> 01:06:43,960
People are disappearing,
Harry. Daily.

828
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,485
We could only place our trust
in a handful of people.

829
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,201
If we started fighting
amongst ourselves,

830
01:06:48,236 --> 01:06:49,112
we're doomed.

831
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:54,052
Ginny!

832
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:14,855
Open up, you.

833
01:07:17,006 --> 01:07:18,088
Don't you trust me?

834
01:07:25,071 --> 01:07:25,670
It's good.

835
01:07:27,231 --> 01:07:28,303
Just, uh, get...

836
01:07:36,744 --> 01:07:38,697
- Pie?
- Not for me. No.

837
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:52,837
You'll have to forgive
Remus.

838
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:55,196
It takes its toll,
his condition.

839
01:07:56,641 --> 01:07:58,308
Are you alright,
Mr. Weasley?

840
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:00,879
We're being followed,
all of us.

841
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:03,750
Most days, Molly doesn't
leave the house.

842
01:08:04,771 --> 01:08:06,529
It's not been easy.

843
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:10,283
Did you get my owl?

844
01:08:10,864 --> 01:08:11,872
Yes, I did.

845
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:17,010
If Dumbledore is traveling,
then perhaps news to the Ministry,

846
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,360
but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

847
01:08:20,565 --> 01:08:22,385
As for Draco Malfoy...

848
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:24,974
I know a bit more.

849
01:08:25,441 --> 01:08:28,702
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

850
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,031
I think from
what you described...

851
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:33,092
What you and Ron
saw at the end of summer,

852
01:08:33,127 --> 01:08:36,193
the object that Draco
is so interested in,

853
01:08:36,876 --> 01:08:38,243
is a Vanishing Cabinet.

854
01:08:39,246 --> 01:08:40,291
A "Vanishing Cabinet"?

855
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:43,950
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

856
01:08:44,739 --> 01:08:45,949
You can see the appeal.

857
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:47,615
Should the Death Eaters
come knocking,

858
01:08:47,898 --> 01:08:51,960
one simply have to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

859
01:08:52,913 --> 01:08:55,063
It transports you
practically anywhere.

860
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:58,211
Tricky contraptions, though.
Very temperamental.

861
01:08:58,524 --> 01:08:59,800
What happened to it?

862
01:09:00,566 --> 01:09:01,819
The one
at Borgin and Burkes?

863
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:02,497
Nothing.

864
01:09:03,735 --> 01:09:04,788
It's still there.

865
01:09:16,713 --> 01:09:18,035
It was delicious,
Molly, really.

866
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,735
Are you sure
you won't stay?

867
01:09:19,784 --> 01:09:20,729
No, we should go.

868
01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:24,134
The first night of the cycle's
always the worst.

869
01:09:24,555 --> 01:09:25,250
Remus?

870
01:09:34,381 --> 01:09:35,360
Sweetheart.

871
01:09:44,155 --> 01:09:45,440
Has Ron
gone to bed?

872
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:48,519
Um, not yet. No.

873
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:51,698
Shoelace...

874
01:10:04,715 --> 01:10:05,868
Merry Christmas, Harry.

875
01:10:07,884 --> 01:10:08,985
Merry Christmas.

876
01:10:26,941 --> 01:10:29,370
- Harry, no!
- Harry! Remus.

877
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:39,772
Ginny!

878
01:10:43,818 --> 01:10:48,332
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!

879
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:50,033
You coming to get me?

880
01:10:52,493 --> 01:10:54,241
Get me!
He's trying to get me!

881
01:11:24,624 --> 01:11:25,616
Harry?

882
01:11:43,556 --> 01:11:44,355
Stupefy!

883
01:12:08,014 --> 01:12:09,601
Harry!

884
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,163
Ginny!

885
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:54,729
Molly.

886
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,860
It's so easy for them
to get to you.

887
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:21,851
You're bloody lucky
you weren't killed.

888
01:13:22,788 --> 01:13:24,695
You have to realise
who you are, Harry!

889
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:26,331
I know who I am,
Hermione, alright.

890
01:13:28,157 --> 01:13:28,710
Sorry.

891
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:33,458
Hon, go somewhere.

892
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:35,814
That's my Won-Won.

893
01:13:38,558 --> 01:13:40,235
Excuse me,
I have to go and vomit.

894
01:14:01,549 --> 01:14:03,065
...Always you ruin
half the start.

895
01:14:09,548 --> 01:14:14,624
Sir, is it true that
Professor Merrythought is retiring?

896
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:17,585
Tom, I couldn't tell you
if I knew, could I?

897
01:14:17,938 --> 01:14:19,695
And by the way,
thank you for the pineapple.

898
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,326
You're quite right.
It is my favorite.

899
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,256
But how did you know?

900
01:14:26,605 --> 01:14:27,940
Intuition.

901
01:14:32,393 --> 01:14:34,346
Good gracious,
is it that time already?

902
01:14:34,381 --> 01:14:37,130
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett
will have us all in detention.

903
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,213
Look sharp, Tom.

904
01:14:44,086 --> 01:14:46,100
Don't be caught
out of bed after hours.

905
01:14:47,595 --> 01:14:49,257
Is something
on your mind, Tom?

906
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:50,372
Yes, sir.

907
01:14:51,414 --> 01:14:53,459
See, I couldnt think of
anyone else to go to.

908
01:14:54,955 --> 01:14:59,390
The other professors...
Well, they're not like you.

909
01:15:00,394 --> 01:15:02,892
They might
misunderstand.

910
01:15:03,614 --> 01:15:04,349
Go on.

911
01:15:05,883 --> 01:15:07,683
I was in the library
the other night.

912
01:15:08,647 --> 01:15:10,480
In the restricted section.

913
01:15:10,515 --> 01:15:15,028
And I picked something
rather odd about this rare magic.

914
01:15:16,272 --> 01:15:18,965
I thought perhaps,
you could illuminate me.

915
01:15:19,775 --> 01:15:24,925
It's called, as I understand it,
Hor...

916
01:15:25,426 --> 01:15:28,807
I beg your pardon?
I don't know anything about such things

917
01:15:28,842 --> 01:15:30,635
and if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

918
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,103
Now get out of here
at once

919
01:15:32,138 --> 01:15:34,651
and dont let me ever catch you
mentioning them again!

920
01:15:38,289 --> 01:15:41,811
Confused?
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

921
01:15:42,715 --> 01:15:43,842
I don't understand.

922
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:45,399
What happened?

923
01:15:45,793 --> 01:15:48,658
This is perhaps the most important
memory I had collected.

924
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:51,328
It is also a lie.

925
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:56,571
This memory has been tempered with
by the same person whose memory it is.

926
01:15:56,606 --> 01:15:58,352
Our old friend,
Professor Slughorn.

927
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:01,425
But why would he temper
with his own memory?

928
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,112
I suspect
he's ashamed of it.

929
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:03,975
Why?

930
01:16:04,407 --> 01:16:05,618
Why, indeed.

931
01:16:06,922 --> 01:16:08,973
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn

932
01:16:09,008 --> 01:16:10,204
and you had done so.

933
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:13,774
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory.

934
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:15,313
Any way you can.

935
01:16:15,806 --> 01:16:17,538
I don't know him
that well, sir.

936
01:16:22,065 --> 01:16:27,072
This memory is everything.
Without it, we are blind.

937
01:16:27,909 --> 01:16:30,980
Without it, we leave
the fate of our world to chance.

938
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:38,175
You have no choice.
You must not fail.

939
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:49,075
I highly recommend,
reacquaint yourself

940
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,791
with the chapter
on antidotes.

941
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,423
Now, I'll tell you more about
bezoars in our next class.

942
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:56,703
Right, off you go.
Elise, don't forget your rat tail.

943
01:17:03,068 --> 01:17:06,392
Aha! It isn't
the Prince of Potions himself!

944
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:08,524
What do I owe
this pleasure?

945
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,162
Oh, sir, I wondered
if I wanted to ask you something.

946
01:17:12,197 --> 01:17:14,228
Ask away, dear boy.
Ask away.

947
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,653
Well, you see the other day,
I was in the library

948
01:17:16,688 --> 01:17:18,690
in the restricted section,
and I came across something

949
01:17:18,725 --> 01:17:21,391
rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

950
01:17:22,727 --> 01:17:25,541
Yes, what was
this rare piece of magic?

951
01:17:25,576 --> 01:17:28,733
Well, I don't know,
but I can't remember the name exactly.

952
01:17:29,093 --> 01:17:31,513
But it just got me wondering,
are there some kinds of magic

953
01:17:31,548 --> 01:17:32,964
you're not allowed
to teach us?

954
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,897
I'm Potions Master,
Harry,

955
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:39,644
I think your question better be
posed to Professor Snape.

956
01:17:40,076 --> 01:17:44,248
Yes, he and I don't
exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.

957
01:17:44,758 --> 01:17:45,643
What I mean
to say is...

958
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,440
Well, he's not like you.

959
01:17:49,362 --> 01:17:50,876
He might misunderstand.

960
01:17:52,758 --> 01:17:56,237
Yes, it would be no light
without the dark.

961
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:57,960
And so
it is with magic,

962
01:17:57,995 --> 01:18:00,154
myself I always strive
to live within the light.

963
01:18:01,227 --> 01:18:02,918
I suggest
you do the same.

964
01:18:03,636 --> 01:18:06,498
Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir,
when he came asking questions?

965
01:18:13,453 --> 01:18:16,110
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

966
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:19,515
Didn't he?

967
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,928
Yes?
Oh, it's you, Potter.

968
01:18:31,392 --> 01:18:33,526
I-I'm sorry,
I'm busy at the moment.

969
01:18:46,545 --> 01:18:48,124
That's beautiful,
isn't it?

970
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:49,831
The moon.

971
01:18:51,448 --> 01:18:52,171
Divine.

972
01:18:53,326 --> 01:18:55,712
Had ourselves a little
late night snack, did we?

973
01:18:56,786 --> 01:19:00,026
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

974
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:01,833
Or twenty?

975
01:19:02,216 --> 01:19:04,132
I can't stop
thinking about her, Harry.

976
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:06,454
Honestly, you know, I reckon
she was starting to annoy you.

977
01:19:06,694 --> 01:19:08,032
She could never annoy me.

978
01:19:10,484 --> 01:19:11,756
I think I love her.

979
01:19:15,569 --> 01:19:17,383
Well, brilliant.

980
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:23,433
Do you think
she knows I exist?

981
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:24,717
I very well hope so.

982
01:19:24,752 --> 01:19:26,107
She's been snogging you
for three months.

983
01:19:26,609 --> 01:19:29,359
Snogging?
Who are you talking about?

984
01:19:30,272 --> 01:19:31,436
Who are you talking about?

985
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:35,543
Romilda, of course.
Romilda Vane.

986
01:19:35,578 --> 01:19:37,148
Okay, very funny.

987
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:42,054
What was that for?

988
01:19:42,089 --> 01:19:43,227
It's no joke.

989
01:19:43,858 --> 01:19:45,341
- I'm in love with her!
- Alright, fine.

990
01:19:45,376 --> 01:19:47,107
You're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

991
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:51,246
No.
Can you introduce me?

992
01:20:12,923 --> 01:20:16,843
Come on, Ron.
I will introduce you to Romilda Vane.

993
01:20:28,647 --> 01:20:29,265
I'm sorry, sir.

994
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,576
I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

995
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:35,992
- Where's Romilda?
- What's the matter with Wimby?

996
01:20:36,988 --> 01:20:38,639
Very powerful love potion.

997
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:40,895
Very well,
better bring him in.

998
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,983
I always thought you could whip up
a remedy for this is in no time, Harry.

999
01:20:45,018 --> 01:20:47,454
Well, I-I thought this called
for more practised hands, sir.

1000
01:20:47,886 --> 01:20:51,296
Hello, darling.
Fancy a drink?

1001
01:20:51,331 --> 01:20:52,500
Perhaps, you're right.

1002
01:20:57,106 --> 01:21:00,444
I'm sorry, by the way, Professor,
about earlier today.

1003
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:02,670
Our misunderstanding.

1004
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:05,901
Oh, not at all.
Old water under the bridge, you know.

1005
01:21:06,178 --> 01:21:06,908
Correct?

1006
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:09,968
Well, I expect you're tired a bit,
after all these years.

1007
01:21:10,895 --> 01:21:13,009
And the questions
about Voldemort.

1008
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,637
Don't use that name!

1009
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:24,607
Here you go, boy.
Bottom's up.

1010
01:21:25,432 --> 01:21:27,715
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

1011
01:21:42,813 --> 01:21:43,936
What happened to me?

1012
01:21:43,971 --> 01:21:47,061
- A love potion.
- A bloody strong one at there.

1013
01:21:47,963 --> 01:21:51,377
- I feel really bad.
- You need to pick me up, my boy.

1014
01:21:51,428 --> 01:21:55,874
Got butterbeer, wine,
dazzling oak-matured mead.

1015
01:21:55,909 --> 01:21:59,196
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances.

1016
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,465
Here you are, Potter.

1017
01:22:03,903 --> 01:22:04,927
To life!

1018
01:22:10,455 --> 01:22:10,947
Ron!

1019
01:22:14,169 --> 01:22:16,979
Ron!
Professor, do something.

1020
01:22:18,283 --> 01:22:20,189
I-I don't understand!

1021
01:22:36,487 --> 01:22:37,949
Come on, Ron,
breathe!

1022
01:23:00,449 --> 01:23:02,867
These girls...
They're gonna kill me.

1023
01:23:14,251 --> 01:23:16,888
Quick thinking on your part,
Harry, using a bezoar.

1024
01:23:17,802 --> 01:23:19,827
You should be very proud
of your student, Horace.

1025
01:23:21,805 --> 01:23:23,427
Ah, yes.
Very proud.

1026
01:23:24,059 --> 01:23:27,099
I think we agree
Potter's actions were heroic.

1027
01:23:27,134 --> 01:23:30,667
The question is:
Why were they necessary?

1028
01:23:31,229 --> 01:23:32,074
I, indeed.

1029
01:23:33,117 --> 01:23:35,048
This appears to be a gift,
Horace.

1030
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:37,410
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

1031
01:23:38,422 --> 01:23:39,986
By the way,
it possesses remarkably

1032
01:23:40,021 --> 01:23:42,044
subtle hints
of liquorice and cherry.

1033
01:23:42,482 --> 01:23:44,146
When not polluted
with poison.

1034
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:47,988
Actually, I had intended
to give it as a gift, myself.

1035
01:23:48,288 --> 01:23:49,631
To whom,
might I ask?

1036
01:23:51,376 --> 01:23:53,089
To you, headmaster.

1037
01:23:56,147 --> 01:23:58,338
Where is he?
Where's my Won-Won?

1038
01:23:59,082 --> 01:24:00,543
Has he been
asking for me?

1039
01:24:04,548 --> 01:24:05,753
What's she doing here?

1040
01:24:06,206 --> 01:24:08,055
I might ask you
the same question.

1041
01:24:08,797 --> 01:24:11,014
I happen to be
his girlfriend.

1042
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:13,596
And I happen to be his...
friend.

1043
01:24:14,017 --> 01:24:15,351
Don't make me laugh.

1044
01:24:15,892 --> 01:24:17,549
You haven't spoken
in weeks.

1045
01:24:19,075 --> 01:24:20,234
I suppose you want
to make up with him

1046
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:22,292
now that he's suddenly
all interesting.

1047
01:24:22,327 --> 01:24:25,041
He's been poisoned,
you daft dimbo!

1048
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:28,139
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1049
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:34,695
See?
He senses my presence.

1050
01:24:35,789 --> 01:24:38,802
Don't worry, Won-Won.
I'm here.

1051
01:24:39,765 --> 01:24:40,858
I'm here.

1052
01:24:47,562 --> 01:24:49,813
Hermione.

1053
01:24:53,607 --> 01:24:55,987
Hermione.

1054
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,020
Hermione.

1055
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:10,394
Oh to be young
and to feel love's keen sting.

1056
01:25:11,322 --> 01:25:13,349
Well, come over,
everybody.

1057
01:25:13,384 --> 01:25:15,942
Mr. Weasley's
well attended.

1058
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,549
About time,
don't you think?

1059
01:25:26,052 --> 01:25:26,916
Thank you.

1060
01:25:30,622 --> 01:25:31,518
Just shut up.

1061
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:45,511
Stop it, Ron.

1062
01:27:46,153 --> 01:27:47,623
You're making it snow.

1063
01:27:52,677 --> 01:27:54,826
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1064
01:27:57,324 --> 01:28:01,144
Well, she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1065
01:28:02,558 --> 01:28:04,741
And you talked.

1066
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:10,475
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1067
01:28:11,339 --> 01:28:14,376
Don't get me wrong.
I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her's.

1068
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:16,433
She seems a bit...
put out.

1069
01:28:23,638 --> 01:28:26,277
Yes, um...
She does, isn't she?

1070
01:28:28,588 --> 01:28:33,201
You say you don't remember
anything from that night.

1071
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:36,243
Anything at all?

1072
01:28:37,027 --> 01:28:38,336
There is something.

1073
01:28:43,037 --> 01:28:44,041
It can't be.

1074
01:28:44,766 --> 01:28:46,352
I was completely boogum,
didn't I?

1075
01:28:48,382 --> 01:28:49,204
Harry...

1076
01:28:58,931 --> 01:28:59,904
Harry...

1077
01:29:01,688 --> 01:29:05,672
That's Katie.
Katie Bell.

1078
01:29:13,799 --> 01:29:16,238
Katie,
how are you?

1079
01:29:17,178 --> 01:29:18,857
I know you're going
to ask, Harry.

1080
01:29:19,678 --> 01:29:21,537
But I don't know
who cursed me.

1081
01:29:22,952 --> 01:29:25,992
I've been trying
to remember. Honestly.

1082
01:29:27,275 --> 01:29:30,078
But I just can't.

1083
01:29:43,863 --> 01:29:44,598
Katie.

1084
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:28,975
I know what you did,
Malfoy.

1085
01:30:29,629 --> 01:30:30,813
You hexed it,
didn't you?

1086
01:31:02,151 --> 01:31:03,022
Sectumsempra!

1087
01:32:24,483 --> 01:32:25,658
You have
to get rid of it.

1088
01:32:26,581 --> 01:32:27,225
Today.

1089
01:32:32,998 --> 01:32:33,968
Take my hand.

1090
01:32:50,493 --> 01:32:51,706
It's the Room of Requirement.

1091
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:00,830
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book.

1092
01:33:01,544 --> 01:33:04,596
Where no one'll ever find it.
Including you.

1093
01:33:13,691 --> 01:33:14,466
- What was that?
- What was that?

1094
01:33:41,012 --> 01:33:44,644
See, you never know
what you'll find up here.

1095
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:07,924
Alright, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1096
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:13,144
Close your eyes.

1097
01:34:18,407 --> 01:34:18,556
S    u    B:
V  e R  d  i K  T

1098
01:34:40,403 --> 01:34:42,397
That can stay hidden
up here too if you like.

1099
01:34:57,896 --> 01:34:59,641
So, did you and Ginny
do it then?

1100
01:35:00,448 --> 01:35:00,970
What?

1101
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:03,286
Well, hide the book?

1102
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,473
Oh, yeah.

1103
01:35:08,384 --> 01:35:10,232
Oh, g--

1104
01:35:11,267 --> 01:35:13,576
Still no luck with Slughorn then,
I take it?

1105
01:35:16,433 --> 01:35:16,931
Luck.

1106
01:35:18,693 --> 01:35:21,273
That's it.
All I need is a bit of luck.

1107
01:35:40,379 --> 01:35:42,597
Well, how do you feel?

1108
01:35:43,684 --> 01:35:44,459
Excellent.

1109
01:35:46,257 --> 01:35:47,700
Really excellent.

1110
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:56,059
Remember, Slughorn usually
leaves early, takes a walk,

1111
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,359
and then
returns to his office.

1112
01:35:58,394 --> 01:36:01,085
Right.
I'm going down to Hagrid's.

1113
01:36:01,361 --> 01:36:01,748
What?

1114
01:36:02,334 --> 01:36:04,902
No, Harry, you've got
to go to speak to Slughorn.

1115
01:36:06,707 --> 01:36:07,560
We have a plan.

1116
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:11,647
I know but I've got a really
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1117
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:13,986
I feel it's--it's
the place to be tonight.

1118
01:36:14,437 --> 01:36:15,105
Do you know
what I mean?

1119
01:36:16,189 --> 01:36:16,941
- No.
- No.

1120
01:36:16,976 --> 01:36:18,624
Well, trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

1121
01:36:18,659 --> 01:36:20,049
Or Felix does.

1122
01:36:22,038 --> 01:36:22,583
Hi!

1123
01:36:27,618 --> 01:36:28,356
Horace.

1124
01:36:29,702 --> 01:36:34,299
Merlin's beard!
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1125
01:36:35,478 --> 01:36:36,803
A dead one,
I think, sir.

1126
01:36:38,313 --> 01:36:39,258
Good God.

1127
01:36:40,233 --> 01:36:42,855
Dear fellow, however
did you manage to kill it?

1128
01:36:44,151 --> 01:36:44,835
"Kill it"?

1129
01:36:45,186 --> 01:36:46,580
My oldest friend,
he was.

1130
01:36:47,564 --> 01:36:48,838
I'm so sorry,
I didn't--

1131
01:36:48,873 --> 01:36:50,961
Ah, don't worry yourself.
You're not alone.

1132
01:36:51,879 --> 01:36:55,096
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1133
01:36:55,697 --> 01:36:58,305
The eyes I reckon,
they unnerve some folk.

1134
01:36:58,340 --> 01:36:59,833
Not to mention
the pincers.

1135
01:37:04,473 --> 01:37:06,068
Yeah,
I reckon that too.

1136
01:37:07,205 --> 01:37:07,782
Hagrid...

1137
01:37:09,008 --> 01:37:10,717
The last thing
I wish to be is indelicate

1138
01:37:10,752 --> 01:37:14,213
but Acromantula venom
is uncommonly rare.

1139
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:17,436
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two,

1140
01:37:17,471 --> 01:37:19,849
purely for academic purposes,
you understand?

1141
01:37:20,406 --> 01:37:23,222
Well I don't suppose it's gonna do him
much good now is it.

1142
01:37:23,257 --> 01:37:24,687
My thoughts exactly.

1143
01:37:24,722 --> 01:37:30,962
I have a ampoule or two about my person
for just such occassions as this.

1144
01:37:31,563 --> 01:37:35,677
Old... Potion master's habit,
you know?

1145
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,961
I wish you could have
seen him with his prime.

1146
01:37:40,025 --> 01:37:41,192
Magnificent, he was.

1147
01:37:41,994 --> 01:37:43,581
Just magnificent.

1148
01:37:55,983 --> 01:37:58,074
Would you like me
to say a few words?

1149
01:37:58,109 --> 01:37:58,494
Yes.

1150
01:37:59,711 --> 01:38:01,060
Had a family, I trust?

1151
01:38:01,095 --> 01:38:01,996
Oh, yeah.

1152
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:11,029
- Farewell...
- Aragog.

1153
01:38:15,926 --> 01:38:19,063
Farewell, Aragog.

1154
01:38:19,098 --> 01:38:21,515
King of the arachnids.

1155
01:38:22,648 --> 01:38:25,422
Your body will decay...

1156
01:38:26,646 --> 01:38:29,555
but your spirit lingers on

1157
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:33,519
and your human friends
find solace,

1158
01:38:33,554 --> 01:38:35,908
the loss
they have sustained.

1159
01:38:37,854 --> 01:38:40,567
# Laid to rest, #

1160
01:38:40,602 --> 01:38:44,693
# And his wand,
snapped in two, #

1161
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:48,903
# Which was sad, #

1162
01:38:52,053 --> 01:38:53,668
I had him from an egg,
you know?

1163
01:38:53,703 --> 01:38:55,882
Tiny little thing he was
when he hatched.

1164
01:38:55,917 --> 01:38:58,195
No bigger
than a Pekingese.

1165
01:38:58,230 --> 01:38:59,940
A Pekingese, mind you.

1166
01:38:59,975 --> 01:39:02,899
How sweet!
I once had a fish.

1167
01:39:02,934 --> 01:39:04,927
Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1168
01:39:04,962 --> 01:39:08,202
One afternoon,
I came downstairs and...

1169
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,244
it vanished.

1170
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:11,316
Poof.

1171
01:39:12,246 --> 01:39:13,490
That's very odd,
isn't it?

1172
01:39:13,525 --> 01:39:17,159
Yes, doesn't it?
But that's life!

1173
01:39:17,194 --> 01:39:20,666
I suppose,
you--you go along with

1174
01:39:20,717 --> 01:39:24,060
and suddenly...
poof.

1175
01:39:25,234 --> 01:39:25,925
Poof.

1176
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:27,987
Poof.

1177
01:39:43,312 --> 01:39:45,671
It was a student
who gave me Francis.

1178
01:39:47,274 --> 01:39:50,633
One spring afternoon,
I discovered the bowl on my desk...

1179
01:39:52,428 --> 01:39:55,033
With just a few inches
of clear water in it...

1180
01:39:56,209 --> 01:39:59,309
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1181
01:40:01,337 --> 01:40:03,333
As I watched, it sank.

1182
01:40:05,019 --> 01:40:07,273
But just before
it reached the bottom,

1183
01:40:08,268 --> 01:40:12,710
it transformed
into a wee fish.

1184
01:40:14,286 --> 01:40:16,677
It was beautiful magic.

1185
01:40:17,854 --> 01:40:19,589
Wondrous to behold.

1186
01:40:22,463 --> 01:40:24,711
The flower petal
had come from a lily.

1187
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:28,652
Your mother.

1188
01:40:30,881 --> 01:40:36,132
The day I came downstairs,
day's the bowl was empty.

1189
01:40:38,213 --> 01:40:39,718
That's the day
your mother...

1190
01:40:44,423 --> 01:40:45,747
I know
why you're here.

1191
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:50,745
But I can't help you.

1192
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:54,427
It would ruin me.

1193
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:00,415
Do you know
why I survived, Professor?

1194
01:41:01,449 --> 01:41:02,845
The night I got this?

1195
01:41:05,043 --> 01:41:09,541
Because of her,
because she sacrificed herself...

1196
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:12,071
Because she refused
to step aside.

1197
01:41:12,422 --> 01:41:15,865
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1198
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:18,778
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.

1199
01:41:20,356 --> 01:41:21,848
I'm going
to tell you something.

1200
01:41:23,343 --> 01:41:25,694
Something others
have only guessed at.

1201
01:41:28,272 --> 01:41:31,850
It's true.
I am the Chosen One.

1202
01:41:32,632 --> 01:41:34,994
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so,

1203
01:41:35,129 --> 01:41:37,295
I need to know
what Tom Riddle asked you

1204
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:38,588
all those years ago
in your office

1205
01:41:38,623 --> 01:41:40,404
and I need to know
what you told him.

1206
01:41:41,597 --> 01:41:43,439
Be brave, Professor.

1207
01:41:45,206 --> 01:41:47,057
Be brave
like my mother.

1208
01:41:48,802 --> 01:41:51,190
Otherwise,
you disgrace her.

1209
01:41:52,213 --> 01:41:54,563
Otherwise,
she died for nothing.

1210
01:41:55,617 --> 01:41:59,282
Otherwise,
the bowl will remain empty.

1211
01:41:59,925 --> 01:42:00,672
Forever.

1212
01:42:11,916 --> 01:42:15,098
Please, don't think badly of me
when you say it.

1213
01:42:16,746 --> 01:42:19,549
I had no idea
what he was like, even then.

1214
01:42:56,810 --> 01:42:58,578
I was in the library
the other day.

1215
01:42:59,714 --> 01:43:01,486
In the restricted section...

1216
01:43:01,736 --> 01:43:05,944
and I read something
rather odd about this rare magic.

1217
01:43:07,882 --> 01:43:12,865
It's called, as I understand it,
a Horcrux.

1218
01:43:14,964 --> 01:43:17,341
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1219
01:43:18,052 --> 01:43:19,919
I came across the term
while reading...

1220
01:43:20,571 --> 01:43:23,202
and I didn't fully
understand it.

1221
01:43:23,873 --> 01:43:25,385
I'm not sure
what you were reading, Tom,

1222
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:28,327
but this is very dark stuff.
Very dark, indeed.

1223
01:43:28,647 --> 01:43:32,710
Which is...
why I came to you.

1224
01:43:35,852 --> 01:43:39,608
A horcrux is an object
in which a person has concealed

1225
01:43:39,643 --> 01:43:40,887
part of their soul.

1226
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:43,959
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1227
01:43:47,141 --> 01:43:50,099
One splits one's soul
and hides part of it in an object.

1228
01:43:51,323 --> 01:43:52,661
By doing so,
you are protected,

1229
01:43:52,696 --> 01:43:54,770
should you be attacked
and your body destroyed.

1230
01:43:54,805 --> 01:43:55,821
Protected?

1231
01:43:56,373 --> 01:43:58,866
That part of your soul
which is hidden lives on.

1232
01:44:00,499 --> 01:44:02,977
In other words,
you cannot die.

1233
01:44:10,683 --> 01:44:12,907
And how does
one splits his soul, sir?

1234
01:44:13,922 --> 01:44:15,981
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1235
01:44:18,037 --> 01:44:18,790
Murder.

1236
01:44:19,894 --> 01:44:26,124
Yes, killing rips the soul apart
and it is a violation against nature.

1237
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,238
Can you only
split the soul once?

1238
01:44:30,273 --> 01:44:32,272
For instance,
isn't seven--

1239
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:36,303
Seven?
Merlin's beard, Tom!

1240
01:44:36,665 --> 01:44:39,549
Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1241
01:44:40,171 --> 01:44:43,232
To rip the soul
in seven pieces!

1242
01:44:45,313 --> 01:44:47,334
This is all hypothetical,
isn't it, Tom?

1243
01:44:47,369 --> 01:44:48,220
All academic?

1244
01:44:52,747 --> 01:44:54,202
Of course, sir.

1245
01:44:57,315 --> 01:44:58,719
It'll be our little secret.

1246
01:45:08,203 --> 01:45:08,941
Sir.

1247
01:45:24,671 --> 01:45:26,624
This is beyond anything
I imagined.

1248
01:45:26,659 --> 01:45:28,340
Do you mean, sir,
he succeeded, sir?

1249
01:45:28,742 --> 01:45:31,602
- In making a Horcrux?
- Oh yes, he succeeded, alright.

1250
01:45:32,085 --> 01:45:34,336
- And not just once.
- What are they exactly?

1251
01:45:34,371 --> 01:45:35,263
It could be anything.

1252
01:45:35,298 --> 01:45:36,965
Most common place
of objects.

1253
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:43,992
A ring, for example,
or a book.

1254
01:45:45,755 --> 01:45:46,857
Tom Riddle's diary.

1255
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:48,493
It's a horcrux, yes.

1256
01:45:48,955 --> 01:45:51,031
Four years ago when you saved
Ginny Weasley's life

1257
01:45:51,066 --> 01:45:53,033
in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1258
01:45:53,393 --> 01:45:55,607
I knew then,
this was a different kind of magic.

1259
01:45:55,642 --> 01:45:57,852
Very dark,
very powerful.

1260
01:45:58,515 --> 01:46:01,189
But until tonight,
I had no idea just how powerful...

1261
01:46:01,224 --> 01:46:03,278
- And the ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1262
01:46:03,313 --> 01:46:07,901
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1263
01:46:08,433 --> 01:46:11,932
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux--

1264
01:46:11,967 --> 01:46:13,265
One destroys Voldemort.

1265
01:46:13,544 --> 01:46:14,657
How would you
find them?

1266
01:46:15,086 --> 01:46:16,778
They could be hidden anywhere,
couldn't they?

1267
01:46:16,813 --> 01:46:19,828
True, but magic,
especially dark magic...

1268
01:46:34,043 --> 01:46:35,115
leaves traces.

1269
01:46:43,163 --> 01:46:44,906
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1270
01:46:45,744 --> 01:46:46,758
When you leave the school.

1271
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:51,173
Yes, and I think perhaps,
I may have found another.

1272
01:46:52,147 --> 01:46:55,665
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1273
01:46:57,853 --> 01:47:01,828
Once again, I must ask
too much of you, Harry.

1274
01:47:06,356 --> 01:47:08,920
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much,

1275
01:47:08,955 --> 01:47:11,745
that you take too much
for granted?

1276
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:14,054
Has it ever crossed
your brilliant mind

1277
01:47:14,089 --> 01:47:16,774
that I don't want
to do this anymore?

1278
01:47:16,884 --> 01:47:19,236
Whether it has or hasn't
is irrelevant.

1279
01:47:19,888 --> 01:47:22,053
I will not negotiate
with you, Severus.

1280
01:47:22,088 --> 01:47:24,993
You agreed.
Nothing more to discuss.

1281
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,023
Oh, Harry...

1282
01:47:48,172 --> 01:47:49,879
You need a shave,
my friend.

1283
01:47:53,424 --> 01:47:56,964
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1284
01:47:57,733 --> 01:48:01,015
At times, I still see
the small boy from the cupboard.

1285
01:48:03,068 --> 01:48:07,245
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.
I'm an old man.

1286
01:48:07,819 --> 01:48:09,187
You still look
the same to me, sir.

1287
01:48:10,907 --> 01:48:13,450
Just like your mother,
you are unfailingly kind.

1288
01:48:13,719 --> 01:48:16,551
A trait people never fail
to undervalue, I'm afraid.

1289
01:48:19,322 --> 01:48:23,824
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1290
01:48:24,804 --> 01:48:28,054
I promise you for the company of me
and I stand by that promise.

1291
01:48:28,486 --> 01:48:29,832
But there's one condition.

1292
01:48:30,415 --> 01:48:33,432
You must obey every command
I give you without question.

1293
01:48:34,436 --> 01:48:35,155
Yes, sir.

1294
01:48:36,018 --> 01:48:37,742
You do understand
what I'm saying.

1295
01:48:39,086 --> 01:48:40,855
Should I tell you to hide,
you hide.

1296
01:48:41,691 --> 01:48:43,577
Should I tell you to run,
you run.

1297
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:47,270
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself,

1298
01:48:47,305 --> 01:48:48,283
you must do so.

1299
01:48:53,391 --> 01:48:54,432
Your word, Harry.

1300
01:48:56,538 --> 01:48:57,188
My word.

1301
01:48:58,749 --> 01:48:59,698
Take my arm.

1302
01:49:01,745 --> 01:49:04,184
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1303
01:49:05,159 --> 01:49:08,187
Well, being me
has its privileges.

1304
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:56,690
This is the place.

1305
01:49:58,076 --> 01:50:02,462
Oh, yes.
This place has known magic.

1306
01:50:11,184 --> 01:50:11,804
Sir.

1307
01:50:11,839 --> 01:50:14,255
In order to gain passage,
payment must be made.

1308
01:50:14,396 --> 01:50:17,168
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1309
01:50:19,608 --> 01:50:20,628
You should have
let me, sir.

1310
01:50:20,663 --> 01:50:24,121
No, no, Harry. Your blood's
much more precious than mine.

1311
01:50:46,468 --> 01:50:50,436
Voldemort would not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1312
01:50:51,210 --> 01:50:53,834
He would put
certain defenses in position.

1313
01:50:57,298 --> 01:50:57,893
Careful.

1314
01:51:22,022 --> 01:51:22,922
There it is.

1315
01:51:24,811 --> 01:51:26,737
The only question is
how do we get there?

1316
01:51:49,722 --> 01:51:50,675
If you would, Harry.

1317
01:52:38,709 --> 01:52:40,372
Do you think
the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1318
01:52:41,461 --> 01:52:42,537
Oh, yes.

1319
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:55,553
It has to be drunk.

1320
01:52:56,254 --> 01:52:58,332
All of it
has to be drunk.

1321
01:52:59,536 --> 01:53:02,081
You remember the conditions
on which I brought you with me?

1322
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:04,854
This potion
might paralyze me.

1323
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,567
I may risk
to get what I'm here.

1324
01:53:08,453 --> 01:53:10,996
I'd cause me so much pain
that I'd beg for relief.

1325
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:13,899
You are not to indulge
these requests.

1326
01:53:13,934 --> 01:53:16,887
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1327
01:53:17,469 --> 01:53:19,961
Even if you have
to force it down my throat.

1328
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:21,313
Understood?

1329
01:53:21,811 --> 01:53:22,842
Why can't I drink it, sir?

1330
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:27,660
Because I'm much older,
much cleverer and much less valuable.

1331
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:33,703
Your good health, Harry.

1332
01:53:50,485 --> 01:53:51,701
Professor.

1333
01:53:53,762 --> 01:53:54,581
Professor!

1334
01:54:03,289 --> 01:54:04,102
Professor.

1335
01:54:05,025 --> 01:54:05,858
Can you hear me?

1336
01:54:07,149 --> 01:54:07,872
Professor!

1337
01:54:25,161 --> 01:54:27,545
You have to keep drinking
like you said, remember?

1338
01:54:36,339 --> 01:54:38,621
- Stop.
- I will stop. I will stop.

1339
01:54:38,656 --> 01:54:41,071
But only--
only if you keep drinking.

1340
01:54:41,512 --> 01:54:44,013
- Don't make me-- Kill me.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1341
01:54:46,078 --> 01:54:47,103
Kill me!

1342
01:54:52,816 --> 01:54:53,651
All my fault.

1343
01:54:55,668 --> 01:54:56,595
My fault.

1344
01:54:57,318 --> 01:55:00,937
Just one more, sir.
One more, I promise.

1345
01:55:00,972 --> 01:55:03,770
- I promise I'll do what you say.
- No, no.

1346
01:55:03,805 --> 01:55:04,694
I promise!

1347
01:55:06,852 --> 01:55:07,482
Please!

1348
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:33,018
Harry.

1349
01:55:40,978 --> 01:55:41,704
Water.

1350
01:55:42,983 --> 01:55:44,962
- Water.
- Water.

1351
01:55:52,338 --> 01:55:53,487
Look, you did it, sir.

1352
01:55:54,415 --> 01:55:55,136
Look.

1353
01:55:57,598 --> 01:56:01,015
Harry...
water.

1354
01:56:03,522 --> 01:56:04,698
Aguamenti!

1355
01:56:05,511 --> 01:56:06,234
Water.

1356
01:56:43,172 --> 01:56:43,785
Lumos.

1357
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:13,965
Lumos maxima!

1358
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:28,794
Stupefy! Stupefy!

1359
01:57:30,153 --> 01:57:31,094
Sectumsempra!

1360
01:57:31,396 --> 01:57:32,833
- Harry...
- Incarcerous!

1361
01:57:33,456 --> 01:57:34,530
- Stupefy!
- Harry...

1362
01:58:34,502 --> 01:58:35,401
Harry...

1363
01:58:39,192 --> 01:58:40,960
Partis Temporus!

1364
01:59:24,286 --> 01:59:26,709
Go to your houses!
No toddling!

1365
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:10,091
We need to get you
to the hospital wing, sir.

1366
02:00:10,674 --> 02:00:11,947
To Madam Pomfrey.

1367
02:00:14,333 --> 02:00:19,253
No...
Severus, Severus is awakening.

1368
02:00:19,514 --> 02:00:19,695
Wake him.
Tell him what happened.

1369
02:00:23,331 --> 02:00:24,500
Speak
to no one else.

1370
02:00:25,777 --> 02:00:27,258
Severus, Harry.

1371
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:34,692
Hide yourself below,
Harry.

1372
02:00:36,822 --> 02:00:39,756
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1373
02:00:40,370 --> 02:00:43,544
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1374
02:00:44,517 --> 02:00:45,810
Harry, do as I say.

1375
02:00:49,867 --> 02:00:50,743
Trust me.

1376
02:00:53,119 --> 02:00:53,960
Trust me.

1377
02:01:14,969 --> 02:01:16,057
Good evening, Draco.

1378
02:01:17,674 --> 02:01:20,900
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1379
02:01:21,165 --> 02:01:23,383
Who else is here?
I heard you talking.

1380
02:01:23,418 --> 02:01:27,449
I often talk aloud to myself.
I find it extraordinarily useful.

1381
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:31,441
Have you always been
to yourself, Draco?

1382
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:39,042
Draco,
you are no assassin.

1383
02:01:39,239 --> 02:01:40,314
How do you know
what I am?

1384
02:01:40,591 --> 02:01:41,988
I've done things
that would shock you.

1385
02:01:42,023 --> 02:01:44,657
Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and
hoping that in return

1386
02:01:44,692 --> 02:01:46,236
she would bear
a cursed necklace to me?

1387
02:01:46,271 --> 02:01:49,322
Like replacing a bottle of mead
with one lace with poison.

1388
02:01:49,357 --> 02:01:51,852
Forgive me, Draco,
I cannot help feel

1389
02:01:51,887 --> 02:01:53,667
these actions are so weak
that your...

1390
02:01:53,967 --> 02:01:55,593
heart can't
really have been in.

1391
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:58,230
He trusts me.
I was chosen.

1392
02:02:03,274 --> 02:02:04,946
I shall make it
easy for you.

1393
02:02:04,981 --> 02:02:05,685
Expelliarmus!

1394
02:02:09,814 --> 02:02:12,383
Very good.
Very good.

1395
02:02:14,071 --> 02:02:14,965
You're not alone.

1396
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:17,522
There are others.

1397
02:02:19,865 --> 02:02:20,367
How?

1398
02:02:22,399 --> 02:02:24,326
The Vanishing Cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1399
02:02:25,832 --> 02:02:26,946
I've been mending it.

1400
02:02:26,981 --> 02:02:30,822
Let me guess, it has a sister.
A twin.

1401
02:02:31,211 --> 02:02:32,313
In Borgin and Burkes.

1402
02:02:32,348 --> 02:02:35,268
- They form a passage.
- Ingenious.

1403
02:02:36,271 --> 02:02:43,176
Draco, years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1404
02:02:44,771 --> 02:02:45,995
Please let me
help you.

1405
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:47,088
I don't want your help.

1406
02:02:48,281 --> 02:02:51,758
Don't you understand?
I have to do this.

1407
02:02:53,223 --> 02:02:54,707
I have to kill you.

1408
02:03:07,274 --> 02:03:10,124
Oh,
look what we have here.

1409
02:03:12,574 --> 02:03:14,370
Well done, Draco.

1410
02:03:18,394 --> 02:03:19,522
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1411
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,575
I think introductions aren't over,
don't you?

1412
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:24,880
Love to, Albus,

1413
02:03:25,601 --> 02:03:27,843
but I'm afraid
we're on a bit of tight schedule.

1414
02:03:29,097 --> 02:03:30,145
Do it!

1415
02:03:32,056 --> 02:03:33,582
He doesn't have
the stomach.

1416
02:03:34,065 --> 02:03:35,548
Just like his father.

1417
02:03:36,553 --> 02:03:38,168
Let me finish him
in my own way.

1418
02:03:38,203 --> 02:03:41,038
No, the Dark Lord was clear
the boy has to do it.

1419
02:03:41,977 --> 02:03:44,606
This is your moment, Draco.
Do it!

1420
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:49,254
Go on, Draco,
now!

1421
02:03:51,030 --> 02:03:51,883
No.

1422
02:04:04,429 --> 02:04:05,242
Severus.

1423
02:04:14,883 --> 02:04:15,877
Please...

1424
02:04:17,169 --> 02:04:18,523
Avada Kedavra.

1425
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,106
Hagrid!

1426
02:05:26,604 --> 02:05:30,338
Snape,
he trusted you!

1427
02:05:35,034 --> 02:05:35,911
Go on!

1428
02:05:37,427 --> 02:05:38,524
Incarcerous!

1429
02:05:39,307 --> 02:05:42,291
Fight back, you coward!
Fight back!

1430
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:46,984
No, he belongs
to the Dark Lord.

1431
02:06:06,876 --> 02:06:08,250
Sectumsempra!

1432
02:06:16,569 --> 02:06:21,197
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1433
02:06:22,701 --> 02:06:28,012
Yes,
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1434
02:10:16,231 --> 02:10:16,945
Potter...

1435
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:20,337
Enlighten
what has happened.

1436
02:10:22,677 --> 02:10:25,156
If you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1437
02:10:27,618 --> 02:10:31,629
You should know...
Professor Dumbledore...

1438
02:10:33,734 --> 02:10:35,470
You meant
a great deal to him.

1439
02:10:54,204 --> 02:10:55,594
Do you think
he would have done it?

1440
02:10:56,717 --> 02:10:57,482
Draco.

1441
02:10:59,472 --> 02:11:00,201
No.

1442
02:11:02,031 --> 02:11:03,646
No, he was lowering
his wand.

1443
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:06,505
In the end,
it was Snape.

1444
02:11:07,630 --> 02:11:09,051
It was always Snape.

1445
02:11:10,636 --> 02:11:11,593
I did nothing.

1446
02:11:19,075 --> 02:11:23,141
It was fake.
Open it.

1447
02:11:34,797 --> 02:11:35,917
To the Dark Lord:

1448
02:11:36,811 --> 02:11:38,753
I know I will be dead
long before you read this

1449
02:11:38,788 --> 02:11:39,535
but I want you
to know

1450
02:11:39,570 --> 02:11:41,462
that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1451
02:11:43,499 --> 02:11:45,347
I have stolen
the real Horcrux

1452
02:11:45,382 --> 02:11:47,391
and intend to destroy it
as soon as I can.

1453
02:11:47,426 --> 02:11:50,868
I face death in the hope
that when you meet your match,

1454
02:11:50,903 --> 02:11:52,595
you will be mortal
once more.

1455
02:11:54,232 --> 02:11:55,294
R.A.B.

1456
02:11:57,110 --> 02:11:59,662
- R.A.B.?
- Don't know.

1457
02:12:01,887 --> 02:12:04,341
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1458
02:12:05,717 --> 02:12:07,429
It means
it was all a waste.

1459
02:12:08,771 --> 02:12:09,607
All of it.

1460
02:12:16,356 --> 02:12:17,805
Ron's okay with you,
you know.

1461
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:19,823
You and Ginny.

1462
02:12:21,277 --> 02:12:24,205
If I were you when he's around,
I'd keep snogging to a minimum.

1463
02:12:26,213 --> 02:12:27,681
I'm not coming back,
Hermione.

1464
02:12:29,231 --> 02:12:31,935
I got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1465
02:12:32,487 --> 02:12:35,137
And I don't know
where that'll leave me,

1466
02:12:35,172 --> 02:12:37,306
but I'll let you and Ron
know where I am...

1467
02:12:37,341 --> 02:12:38,097
when I can.

1468
02:12:40,074 --> 02:12:42,111
I've always admired
your courage, Harry.

1469
02:12:43,064 --> 02:12:44,949
But sometimes,
you can be really thick.

1470
02:12:48,671 --> 02:12:50,416
You don't really think
you're going to be able

1471
02:12:50,436 --> 02:12:52,723
to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1472
02:12:57,704 --> 02:12:58,966
You need us, Harry.

1473
02:13:15,121 --> 02:13:17,607
I never realised
how beautiful this place was.
